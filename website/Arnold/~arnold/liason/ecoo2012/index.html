AN IRISH FRIENDSHIP WISH

Good Luck!! I hope it works...

May there always be work for your hands to do;
May your purse always hold a coin or two;
May the sun always shine on your windowpane;
May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain;
May the hand of a friend always be near you;
May God fill your heart with gladness to cheer you.

OK, this is what you have to do....

Send this to all of your friends! But - you HAVE to send this within 1 hour from when you open it!

Now.................Make A wish!!!!!!

I hope you made your wish! Now then, if you send to:

1 person --- your wish will be granted in 1 year

3 people --- 6 months
5 people --- 3 months
6 people --- 1 month
7 people --- 2 weeks
8 people --- 1 week
9 people --- 5 days
10 people --- 3 days
12 people --- 2 days
15 people --- 1 day
20 people --- 3 hours

If you delete this after you read it... you will have 1 year of bad luck! But... if you send it 2
of your friends you will automatically have 3 years of good luck!!! :-)

	<li> Asexual reproduction
<p>BacteriaPlan: grow yourself, when you are large enough
	split in two. Each of you now follows the BacteriaPlan.
</p>
	<li> Sexual reproduction
<p>PeoplePlan: grow yourself, when you are old enough,
	repeat: find someone to have a baby with and have a baby. 
	The baby follows the PeoplePlan.

The Plan:
	Find 2 people (p and q)
	Sell this plan to them for $4
	Make sure that p and q follow this plan
	Send 50% of what p and q send you to
	the person that sold you this plan.

<h3>Problem Solving with Recursion</h3>
<p>Recursion is a problem solving technique which uses recursion to solve problems</p>
In general it looks like...
<xmp>
def solve(p):
    if p is simple enough:
        s=simple solution to p
    else: 
        break p into problems p1,...,pk where
            each of p1,...,pk 'looks like' p
            each of p1,...,pk is 'simpler' than p
        s1=solve(p1) # recursive call to solve
        s2=solve(p2) # recursive call to solve
            .
            .
            .
        sk=solve(pk) # recursive call to solve

	# combine the solutions to the smaller problems
        # into a solution s for p (our current problem)
        s=combine(s1,...,sk) 
    return s

Consider a checkerboard which has dimensions 2^2000 by 2^2000. Now remove 1 square. You
want to tile the checkerboard with L shaped tiles.
You must not cover the 'removed' square. Prove that, no matter which square you remove, you
can always completely tile the resulting checkerboard.

A tile looks like ...

oo
</xmp>
<li> Prove that an arrangement of n lines in the plane can be colored using at most 2 colors. 
	You are coloring the regions bounded by the lines. 
	No edge can have the same color on both sides. 
	That is, two adjacent regions (sharing an edge) can not have the same color.

<li> Print 1 to n recursively. Print n to 1 recursively. Sum up numbers from i to j recursively.  <a href=sum.py>sum.py</a>
<li> McNugget problem (which amounts are buyable):
<xmp>
In McDonalds, you can purchase packs of 4, 6 and 10 McNuggets.
Call a number n buyable if you can purchase packs
summing up to a total of exactly n McNuggets.

Clearly 4,6 and 10 McNuggets are buyable.
16 is buyable (10+6).
Is 23 buyable?
Is 197 buyable?
Is n buyable?
