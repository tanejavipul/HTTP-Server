<h3>I <u><i>Understand</i></u></h3>
<ul>
<li> Understand the question. Understand all parts of the question, are all
	terms familiar. What does a solution look like?
<li> Understand the problem. See structure, relationships. You fully understand the problem when you have the solution.
<li> What does it feel like to understand? People typically don't know that they don't understand or that there is something to understand.
<li> How do I know that I understand? Indicators:
	<ul>
	<li> Ability to simply and concisely express yourself (ie in english).
	<li> See connections.
	<li> Situation seems simple (have an aesthetic sense, don't be satisfied with complexities, things tend to be simple once you understand). Strip away all unnecessary data, connections, facts etc.
	<li> Ability to explain "WHY", justify your position. I see the reason behind everything.
	<li> I am <b>certain</b> that I am correct (since I sufficiently argued all points with myself).

		<table border>
		<tr><th>Mark</th><th>What you did</th></tr>
		<tr><td>5</td><td><b>Reason, apply, problem solve, present:</b> 
			Correctly applies ideas to reach a clear, concise, correct, cleanly presented solution. Can reason 
			about ideas presented. Can apply them to different settings. etc. Minor technical flaws allowed.
		</td></tr>
		<tr><td>4</td><td>As in 5 but lacks some clarity, not as concise as possible, some minor flaw, not a clean presentation.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td>
		<td>
		<b>Semantics:</b> Demonstrates correct understanding of basic definitions, ability to correctly apply basic techniques,
		theorem statements etc.
		<tr><td>2</td><td>Some major flaw in the understanding of basic definitions, techniques, theorem statements.
			Examples are: Applies theorems to wrong settings. 
			Does not understand the goal (ie tries to prove the wrong result).
			Solves the wrong problem.
		</td></tr>
		<tr><td>1</td><td><b>Syntax: </b>Ability to restate given definitions, theorems, techniques.</td></tr>

	</ul>
<li> Develop an aesthetic sense. A simple solution is best. A concise explanation indicates understanding.
</ul>

<h3><u><i>I</i></u> Understand</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>You are part of the problem.
	<li>Goal: Teach yourself enough about the problem so that the solution is <b>simple, clear and obvious</b>.
	<li> I am human!!
	<li> Price to pay in order to understand.
	<li> We only learn simple things.
	<li> Keep your EGO out of it. No "I'm stupid" etc. 
	</ul>

<h3><u><i>I Understand</i></u></h3>
	<ul>
	<li> How do I teach myself? Know what you know, know what you don't and how to cover the difference.
	<li> Be introspective
	<li> Be willing to say "I don't understand."
	<li> Take action <b>NOW</b> (put the problem in your brain)
	<li> Try something AND LEARN FROM IT.
	<li> Know what you are doing and why.
        <li> Doing something simple 
        <li> No matter what, there is always some evidence for... 
	<li> You are always making progress if you LEARN.
	<li> Move from firm ground to firm ground.
	</ul>

<h3> Common mistakes </h3>
	<ul>
	<li> Wait for answer to pop into your head.
	<li> Don't get started early. Put problem in your head, allow your brain
		time to connect and understand.
	<li> Not recognizing the cost (effort required) to obtain the solution.
	<li> Not addressing the abilities you are lacking in order to solve the problem.
	<li> Not checking yourself. Ask yourself "Is it correct?"
	<li> Managing yourself poorly (getting down on yourself).
	<li> Fear of others knowing that you are stupid. Not asking questions in class.
		'stupid' is irrelevant. The winner is the one that comes out of class understanding the most.
	<li> Not learning from your efforts.
	<li> Not simplifying, breaking down problem.
	<li> Not committing yourself to understanding UGLY points.
	<li> Not knowing that you don't know.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Problems</h3>
<ol>
<li> Learning a new programming language
<li> How many 0s are at the end of 999! (<a href=Num0s.java>Num0s.java</a>
	<a href=Num0s.pl>Num0s.pl</a>)
<li> Find the last non-zero digit in 999!
<li> Locker Room problem (<a href=LockerRoom.java>LockerRoom.java</a>)
<p>
	A locker room has lockers numbered 0,1,2,...,1023. All
	lockers are initially closed.
<xmp>
	 The first person walks in and flips every locker
	 The 2nd person flips every other locker (starting at 0)
	 The 3rd person flips every third locker (starting at 0)
            .
            .
            .
	The 1023 person flips every 1023 locker (starting at 0)
</xmp>
At the end, which lockers are open and which are closed?
	
<li> Card swapping problem: 25 people in a circle, a deck of 50 cards
	with numbers 1,1,2,2,...,25,25 on them. Each person gets 2 
	randomly selected cards. At each step, each person looks at 
	their two cards and passes a smallest card left.
	<p> Prove that eventually some person will be holding
	two cards with the same number on them.
