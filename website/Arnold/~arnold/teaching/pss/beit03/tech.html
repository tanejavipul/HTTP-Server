        provides the tools and processes required for the exploration of both the known
        and the unknown world.</p> 
      <p>The power of technology, its pervasiveness, and its continual advances
        demand a rigorous curriculum and the commitment of educators to understand it,
        promote its responsible use, and enable students to become problem solvers who
        are self-sufficient, entrepreneurial, and technologically literate. Students
        must acquire the technological skills and knowledge required to participate in
        a competitive, global economy. They must become critical and innovative
        thinkers, able to question, understand, and respond to the implications of
        technological innovation, as well as to find solutions and develop products.</p> 
      <p>Technological education focuses on developing students&#146; ability
        to work creatively and competently with technologies that are central to their
        lives. Their development as technologically literate individuals throughout
        elementary and secondary school enhances their success in postsecondary studies
        and in the workplace. The policy outlined in this secondary school curriculum
        document is designed to ensure that technological education in Ontario meets
        the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.</p> 
      <p>Technological education promotes the integration of learning across
        subject disciplines. For example, in designing a technological tool, students
        may gain information about its intended use (social science), about the
        materials used in its construction (science), about mathematical relationships
        describing its dimensions and shape (mathematics), and about the aesthetic
        qualities of its design (the arts); they may also create text that outlines
        procedures for the tool&#146;s use (language). Similarly, technology supports
        students&#146; work in other subjects. It develops research skills, supports
        development in literacy and mathematics, and fosters creativity, critical
        thinking, and problem solving. In addition, it promotes global citizenship and
        environmental awareness.</p> 
      <p>Technological education contributes to learning in other areas of the
        curriculum by providing practical contexts and applications for the knowledge
        and skills acquired. For example, the technological education program relates
        to science in that students use scientific principles to design buildings and
        machines, and to history, the social sciences, and the humanities in that
        students assess the impact of the introduction of technologies on historical
        and current events. Technological education relies on English and literacy
        skills for the description of specifications, proposals, and evaluations, and
        has ties to the arts through its use of various media to model and present
        ideas and products. In technological education, students also consider the
        options provided by various technologies as they affect health and physical
        well-being. The connection to business studies is evident in the application of
        business principles to the study of the production and marketing of products in
        technological education.</p> 
      <p>Subject matter from any course in technological education can be
        combined with subject matter from one or more courses in other disciplines to
        create an interdisciplinary course. The policies and procedures regarding the
        development of interdisciplinary courses are outlined in the interdisciplinary
        studies curriculum policy document.</p> 
      <p>The organization of expectations in strands flows from the elementary
        science and technology curriculum into the secondary curriculum in
        technological education. In this continuum, there is a similar emphasis on key
        ideas (theory and foundation), technological processes (skills and processes),
        and the relationship between technology and the world (impact and
        consequences).</p> </td></tr></table><br />

      <h2>Overview</h2> 
      <p>The technological education program in Grades 11 and 12 encompasses
        both broad-based technology and computer studies, each involving a unique
        approach to curriculum content and delivery. Courses in broad-based technology
        are described in Part A of this document, and courses in computer studies are
        described in Part B.</p> 
      <p><em><strong>Part A: Broad-Based Technology.</strong></em> The philosophy that
        underlies the teaching of broad-based technology is that students learn best by
        doing. The curriculum in this area takes an activity-based, project-driven
        approach to learning that provides students with knowledge, skills, and
        experiences in the subjects of their choice. Courses are offered in the
        following subjects:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li> communications technology </li> 
        <li> construction technology </li> 
        <li> health and personal services </li> 
        <li> hospitality and tourism </li> 
        <li> manufacturing technology </li> 
        <li> technological design </li> 
        <li> transportation technology </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>Each area of study is based on a broad, systematic framework of ten
        concepts that describe the different types of technological knowledge and
        skills. It is important for students to understand and use these concepts,
        which can assist them in analysing and classifying technological problems and
        identifying the most effective ways of solving those problems. The ten concepts
        that provide the framework for technological education are as follows:</p> 
      <ol> 
        <li> <em>Structure:</em> The essential physical or conceptual parts of a
          product, process, or system, including the way in which the parts are
          constructed or organized. </li> 
        <li><em> Material:</em> The substances or information used to make the
          structure. </li> 
        <li><em> Fabrication:</em> The act or process of forming and assembling
          materials and structures. </li> 
        <li><em> Mechanism:</em> The parts of a structure that allow it to work
          or function. </li> 
        <li><em> Power and energy:</em> The resource that enables a mechanism to
          perform work. </li> 
        <li><em> Controls:</em> The means by which a mechanism is activated and
          regulated. </li> 
        <li><em> Systems:</em> The combinations of interrelated parts (structures
          and/or mechanisms) that make up a whole and that may be connected with other
          systems. </li> 
        <li><em> Function:</em> The use for which a product, process, or system
          is developed. </li> 
        <li><em> Aesthetics:</em> The aspects of a product, process, or system
          that make it pleasing to the human senses. </li> 
        <li><em> Ergonomics:</em> The aspects of a product, process, or system
          that allow people to use it efficiently &#150; that is, with minimal waste of
          time or energy. </li> 
      </ol> 
      <p><strong><em>Part B: Computer Studies.</em></strong> In computer studies, the
        computer itself is the object of study. Computer studies is concerned with how
        computers represent objects (e.g., a list of names, a graphical image, an
        electronic circuit) and how they receive and process instructions to manipulate
        these representations. Courses are offered in the following subjects:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li> computer and information science </li> 
        <li> computer engineering </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p><strong><em>Courses and Credits.</em></strong> In Grades 11 and 12, three types of
        courses are offered in the technological education curriculum:
        university/college preparation, college preparation, and workplace preparation
        courses. (See <em><a href="../../progplan/progplan.html">The Ontario Curriculum,
        Grades 9 to 12: Program Planning and Assessment, 2000</a></em> for a description
        of the various types of secondary school courses.)</p> 
      <p>Courses in Grades 11 and 12 are designed to be offered as full-credit
        courses. However, half-credit courses may be developed for specialized
        programs, such as school-work transition and apprenticeship programs, as long
        as the original course is not designated as a requirement for entry into a
        university program. Individual universities will identify the courses that are
        prerequisites for admission to specific programs. Such courses must be offered
        as full-credit courses, to ensure that students meet admission requirements.
        </p> 
      <p>In Grades 9-12, half-credit courses, which require a minimum of 55
        hours of scheduled instructional time, must adhere to the following
        conditions:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li> The two half-credit courses created from a full course must
          together contain all of the expectations of the full course, drawn from all of
          the strands of that course and divided in a manner that best enables students
          to achieve the required knowledge and skills in the allotted time. </li> 
        <li> A course that is a prerequisite for another course in the
          secondary curriculum may be offered as two half-credit courses, but students
          must successfully complete both parts of the course to fulfil the prerequisite.
          (Students are not required to complete both parts unless the course is a
          prerequisite for another course that they wish to take.) </li> 
        <li> The title of each half-credit course must include the designation
          Part 1 or Part 2. A half-credit (0.5) will be recorded in the credit-value
          column of both the report card and the Ontario Student Transcript. </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>Boards will ensure that all half-credit courses comply with the
        conditions described above, and will report all half-credit courses to the
        ministry annually in the School September Report.</p> 
      <p>In broad-based technology, courses in Grades 10, 11, and 12 that lead
        to apprenticeship or certification programs or that are part of school-work
        transition programs may be planned for up to 330 hours of scheduled
        instructional time. This additional instructional time allows for the practice
        and refinement of skills needed to raise the quality of students&#146;
        performance to the levels required for certification, entry into apprenticeship
        programs, or participation in school-work transition programs. (It may also
        support articulation agreements for advanced standing or preferred entrance
        into specialized programs.) Instructional time may be increased by increments
        of 55 hours; for each additional 55 hours, students earn an additional
        half-credit. A maximum of three credits may be earned for the successful
        completion of a 330-hour course. The number of additional credits and the
        nature of the assignments to be completed must be established before the start
        of the course. </p> 
      <p>In all subjects included in the broad-based technology program, the
        courses developed by schools must cover a range of areas and applications
        within the subject. In manufacturing technology and technological design, the
        courses outlined in this document allow for the treatment of a wide variety of
        subject areas and applications. In communications technology, construction
        technology, health and personal services, and transportation technology, the
        areas that must be addressed in every course are specified in the course
        descriptions and subject overviews given in this document. For example, it is
        expected that students taking a course in transportation technology will study
        land, air, and marine transportation, and that students taking a course in
        communications technology will learn about electronic, live, recorded, and
        graphic communications. In any broad-based technology subject, courses may be
        developed to emphasize a particular area (e.g., land transportation in
        transportation technology), but not to the exclusion of other areas within the
        subject. <em>Regardless of the area emphasized in a course, students must be
        given the opportunity to achieve all of the expectations of the course outlined
        in this document.</em> Some schools may wish to offer more than one course
        developed from a course outlined in this document, each emphasizing a different
        area of the subject. In such cases, students may earn credit for the successful
        completion of only one of the courses offered.</p> 
      <p>In courses that emphasize a particular area or that exceed 110 hours
        of scheduled instructional time to allow students to prepare for certification,
        apprenticeship programs, or school-work transition programs, the content and
        the skills and processes related to the area of emphasis and/or the additional
        practice should reflect current industry practices and standards.</p> 
      <p>The principal of a school will retain on file up-to-date copies of the
        outlines of all courses of study for courses offered at the school. Each
        outline of a course of study will include the overall expectations for the
        course identified in this document; an outline of the course content based on
        the specific expectations, including unit titles listed in the sequence in
        which the material will be studied; and all of the other items specified in
        section 7.1.1 of <em>Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and
        Diploma Requirements, 1999</em>.</p> 
      <p>All technological education courses must be identified by the
        five-character course code given in this document (e.g., TTJ3C for
        Transportation Technology, Grade 11, College Preparation). Schools may add a
        sixth character to the code to indicate additional information. For example, if
        a school offers both a one-credit and a three-credit Grade 11 college
        preparation course in transportation technology that emphasizes land
        transportation, TTJ3C<strong>1</strong> could be used to identify the course worth one
        credit, and TTJ3C<strong>2</strong> could be used to identify the course worth three
        credits. If the school also offers one-credit and three-credit courses
        emphasizing air transportation, the code TTJ3C<strong>3</strong> could be used to
        identify the course worth one credit, and TTJ3C<strong>4</strong> could be used to
        identify the course worth three credits. In school calendars, the area of
        emphasis of a course may be identified by adding a descriptive word or phrase
        to the course title and an additional sentence to the course description
        provided in this document.</p> 
      <p>If a school or board identifies a need among students and/or the
        community for a course that is not represented among the courses outlined in
        this curriculum policy document, the school or board may wish to apply to the
        ministry to offer a locally developed course. Information on locally developed
        courses can be found on the ministry&#146;s website, at
        http://www.edu.gov.on.ca.</p>

      <h2>Teaching Approaches</h2> 
      <p>Technological education involves knowing, doing, testing, designing
        and building, and evaluating. Teaching and learning approaches should address
        all of these areas. Students should use projects as a major means of achieving
        these expectations, and they should be provided with a combination of
        information and experience that will prepare them to make informed choices
        about the use of various technologies, to use technology wisely and well, and
        to solve technological problems. Students will be involved in:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li> investigating technological products, systems, and processes;  </li> 
        <li> gaining knowledge of the principles and processes of technology;  </li> 
        <li> exploring needs that can be met through technology; </li> 
        <li> creating and evaluating alternatives and modifications in relation
          to these needs; </li> 
        <li> developing safe and efficient work habits; </li> 
        <li> making products that satisfy defined specifications and standards
          of quality and safety; </li> 
        <li> making connections between technology and society (past, present,
          and future); </li> 
        <li> assessing related career opportunities and requirements; </li> 
        <li> developing confidence to contribute to a technological society. </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>It is important that students have opportunities to learn in a variety
        of ways. Programs in technological education should involve an open,
        collaborative, activity-based approach to teaching that accommodates
        students&#146; interests, aspirations, and learning styles. Activities should
        be designed to include both individual and team approaches, as technological
        projects in the workplace often require individuals to work collaboratively
        while undertaking a variety of roles and tasks. Students should be given
        opportunities to work both independently and with teacher direction, and to
        learn through the study of examples followed by practice. There is no single
        correct way to teach or to learn, and the strategies used in the classroom
        should vary according to the curriculum expectations and the needs of the
        students.</p> 
      <p>Teachers should work collaboratively with colleagues to plan and
        deliver the technological education curriculum. Individual teachers can
        contribute their expertise in particular areas of technology to ensure the
        successful implementation of the curriculum.</p> 
      <h2>Curriculum Expectations</h2> 
      <p>The expectations identified for each course describe the knowledge and
        skills that students are expected to develop and demonstrate in their class
        work, on tests, and in various other activities on which their achievement is
        assessed and evaluated.</p> 
      <p>Two sets of expectations are listed for each <em>strand</em>, or broad
        curriculum area, of each course. The <em>overall expectations</em> describe in
        general terms the knowledge and skills that students are expected to
        demonstrate by the end of each course. The <em>specific expectations</em>
        describe the expected knowledge and skills in greater detail. The specific
        expectations in some courses are organized under subheadings that reflect
        particular aspects of the required knowledge and skills and that may serve as a
        guide for teachers as they plan learning activities for their students.The
        organization of expectations in strands and subgroupings is not meant to imply
        that the expectations in any one strand or group are achieved independently of
        the expectations in the other strands or groups.</p> 
      <p>Many of the expectations are accompanied by examples, given in
        parentheses. These examples are meant to illustrate the kind of skill, the
        specific area of learning, the depth of learning, and/or the level of
        complexity that the expectation entails. They are intended as a guide for
        teachers rather than as an exhaustive or mandatory list.</p> 
      <h2>Strands</h2> 
      <p>The overall and specific expectations for each course in the
        technological education program are organized in three distinct but related
        strands. While each strand is represented in all courses, not all parts of the
        definition of each strand may apply to all courses.</p> 
      <p><strong><em>Theory and foundation.</em></strong> The key ideas about concepts,
        components and systems, materials, services, and products.</p> 
      <p><strong><em>Skills and processes.</em></strong> The technological skills and
        processes required for responding to a variety of practical challenges.</p> 
      <p><strong><em>Impact and consequences.</em></strong> Safety-related issues, career
        opportunities, and the implications of technology.</p> </td></tr></table><br />

      <h2>Overview</h2> 
      <p>Whether residential, commercial, industrial, or recreational,
        construction has always played a central role in human life. Through
        construction courses that incorporate learning opportunities outside school,
        students will learn about the tools, equipment, and processes required to
        design, construct, and maintain a variety of buildings and structures. They
        will also learn about the construction industry&#146;s health and safety
        standards, building codes and regulations, and employment opportunities and
        careers in the various sectors of the industry. Note that a construction
        project may result in a product, system, process, or service. It may also
        involve production, repair, or maintenance. </p> 
      <p>The Grade 11 construction courses focus on residential and light
        construction systems related to commercial, industrial, and/or recreational
        buildings and structures. The Grade 12 courses focus on advanced residential
        and more complex construction, as well as the introduction of heavy
        construction systems, related to commercial, industrial, and/or recreational
        buildings and structures.</p> 
      <p>Links and partnerships with construction associations, home builders
        associations, and local business and industry should be established to provide
        students with opportunities to learn about careers in the construction
        industry. </p> 
      <p><em>Note:</em> Working with wood as a material, other than in building
        construction, is included under manufacturing technology or technological
        design.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2> 
      <p>Manufacturing is the transformation of materials into products to meet
        human needs and wants. In today&#146;s global economy, manufacturing is the
        foundation of a nation&#146;s wealth and power. These courses provide students
        with opportunities to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to understand,
        use, and manage manufacturing systems. They will also help students understand
        the role of manufacturing technology in our economy; its relationship to other
        economic sectors; and its effects on people, society, and the environment.
        Their study of manufacturing technology will prepare students for change and
        for making critical decisions regarding the future.</p> 
      <p><em>Note:</em> Working with wood as a material, other than in building
        construction, can be one of the areas of application in the manufacturing
        courses.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2> 
      <p>To look at a skyscraper, a powerful automobile, a robotic assembly
        line, or a bridge linking two shores is to see the work of a technical
        designer. A designer&#146;s role is to apply knowledge of materials,
        mathematics, trends, and fabrication methods to formulate or innovate products,
        services, and methods. The technologies and processes used to create design
        solutions may include both traditional and computer-based drawing methods and
        models, animations and simulations, and displays.</p> 
      <p>Technological design education focuses on the practical application of
        the principles of design, engineering, and architecture to promote solutions to
        challenges in communications, manufacturing, electronics, transportation, and
        architecture. Students will develop the analytic skills required to determine
        user needs, to generate many solutions, and to select the most suitable one.
        They will also acquire the communication skills needed to present the solution
        in the form of technical drawings, models, reports, and displays; the technical
        skills required to perform engineering and scientific tests and analyses; and
        the evaluation skills needed to compare the chosen solution to the original
        problem.</p> 
      <p><em>Note:</em> Furniture design can be included as one of the areas of
        application in technological design courses.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2> 
      <p>Transportation affects our lives in a multitude of ways. We use cars
        for everyday purposes, mass transit to commute to work, and flights and cruises
        for holidays. Transportation systems move raw materials to manufacturers and
        finished products to consumers locally, nationally, and globally.</p> 
      <p>Transportation technology courses provide students with opportunities
        to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to service, repair, and modify
        vehicles and vehicle systems. Student will also learn about the organization
        and management of transportation services and mass-transit systems.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2> 
      <p>Computer and information science is more than running application
        programs and programming. Rather, it relates to the ways in which computers
        represent conceptual objects and how computer systems allow those objects to
        interact. Computer and information science is the study of ways of representing
        objects and processes. It involves defining problems, analysing and designing
        solutions, and developing, testing, and maintaining programs.</p> 
      <p>Computer and information science education is relevant for all
        students because it incorporates a broad range of transferable problem-solving
        skills and techniques. It combines logical thinking, creative design,
        synthesis, and evaluation, and also teaches generically useful skills in such
        areas as communication, time management, organization, and teamwork.</p> 
      <p>Computer and information science will prepare students for an
        increasingly technological world. A foundation in this discipline will
        introduce students to the excitement and opportunities afforded by this dynamic
        field and will begin to prepare them for careers in information technology.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2> 
      <p>Computer engineering is an expanding branch of engineering with roots
        in both electrical engineering and computer science. It includes the design,
        operation, and maintenance of computer hardware and peripherals (printers,
        scanners, multimedia devices, and so on). Computer engineers work in every
        sector of society and industry designing new products and services. Within the
        field of computer engineering there are also a number of areas of
        specialization including communications, control systems, and software
        engineering.</p> 
      <p>Computer engineering education provides a hands-on understanding of
        the technology involved in many consumer products and industrial processes. It
        also teaches generically useful skills, including communication, time
        management, organization, and teamwork.</p> 
      <p>Ontario high school students can now interact directly with computer
        hardware and peripherals and gain a better understanding of the opportunities
        that this field presents. A foundation in this discipline will provide students
        with an introduction to the excitement and opportunity offered by computer
        engineering and will begin to prepare them for careers in computer hardware and
        networking.</p>

      <tr><td><p>Teachers who are planning a program in technological education must
        take into account considerations in a number of important areas. Essential
        information that pertains to all disciplines is provided in <em><a
        href="../../progplan/progplan.html">The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 9 to 12:
        Program Planning and Assessment, 2000</a></em>. The areas of concern to all
        teachers that are outlined there include the following:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li> types of secondary school courses </li> 
        <li> education for exceptional students </li> 
        <li> the role of technology in the curriculum </li> 
        <li> English as a second language (ESL) and English literacy
          development (ELD) </li> 
        <li> career education </li> 
        <li> cooperative education and other workplace experiences </li> 
        <li> health and safety </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>Considerations relating to the areas listed above that have particular
        relevance for program planning in technological education are noted here.</p> 
      <p><strong><em>Education for Exceptional Students.</em></strong> The Education Act
        and regulations made under the act require school boards to provide exceptional
        students with special education programs and services that are appropriate for
        their needs. </p> 
      <p>An Individual Education Plan (IEP) must be developed and maintained
        for each student who is identified as exceptional by an Identification,
        Placement, and Review Committee (IPRC). The IEP must outline, as appropriate,
        any modified or alternative curriculum expectations and any accommodations
        (i.e., the specialized support and services) that are required to meet the
        student&#146;s needs. The IEP must also identify the methods by which the
        student&#146;s progress will be reviewed. For exceptional students who are
        fourteen years of age or older and who are not identified solely as gifted, the
        IEP must contain a plan to help them make the transition to postsecondary
        education, apprenticeship programs, or the workplace, and to help them live as
        independently as possible in the community.</p> 
      <p>An IEP may also be prepared for a student with special needs who is
        receiving special education programs and/or services but who has not been
        identified as exceptional by an IPRC.</p> 
      <p>In planning courses in technological education, teachers must ensure
        that accommodations are made to meet the needs of exceptional students as set
        out in their IEPs. For example, teachers should recognize that some students
        may require focused and specialized directions and advance practice in using
        equipment, perhaps with the help of a peer. Issues relating to students&#146;
        ability to use equipment and read accompanying manuals must be addressed before
        students can be expected to participate effectively.</p> 
      <p><strong><em>The Role of Technology in the Curriculum.</em></strong> Technological
        education encompasses both broad-based technology and computer studies, each of
        which is unique in its approach to information technology. Students will use
        applications such as computer-assisted design, engine analysis software, or
        network management software specific to technological education courses. Using
        an activity-based, project-driven approach to learning, they will also develop
        information technology skills to increase their generic knowledge and support
        their development of skills such as writing, problem solving, research, and
        communication. In computer studies courses, students will have an opportunity
        to create software by designing, writing, and testing computer programs, and
        they will also learn to assemble, manage, and troubleshoot the complex systems
        that support these computing activities.</p> 
      <p><strong><em>English As a Second Language and English Literacy Development
        (ESL/ELD).</em></strong> Through a student-centred, project-driven approach, courses
        in technological education provide all students with an opportunity to develop
        and demonstrate their knowledge and skills through practical applications.
        However, given the importance of health and safety issues in this discipline,
        there are specific challenges for ESL and ELD students. It is critical that
        teachers ensure that these students fully comprehend rules concerning the safe
        use of tools and equipment, and understand the health and safety regulations
        related to working in a shop. ESL and ELD students may also need support in
        learning the technical terminology that is specific to technological
        education.</p> 
      <p><strong><em>Career Education.</em></strong> In each technological education
        course, students assess related education and career opportunities and
        requirements, as well as the pathways from school to work. Where possible,
        students will visit work sites and interact with volunteer mentors. In
        addition, by learning to work independently and cooperatively to complete
        relevant tasks and produce useful products, students will appreciate and
        understand the expectations of the workplace.</p> 
      <p><strong><em>Cooperative Education and Other Workplace Experiences.</em></strong>
        Technological education programs lend themselves well to planned learning
        activities outside the classroom. Wherever possible, students should be
        encouraged to participate in programs such as cooperative education,
        school-work&#150;transition programs (including the Ontario Youth
        Apprenticeship Program), and programs related to articulation agreements. In
        general, technological education programs should be designed to take advantage
        of local opportunities for students to combine work experience and classroom
        learning. Programs may also be modified to reflect community needs. In-class
        and out-of-class components must be carefully matched and monitored so that
        students&#146; learning experiences are relevant and authentic.</p> 
      <p><strong><em>Health and Safety.</em></strong> Health and safety are of paramount
        importance in technological education programs. As part of every course,
        students must be made aware that health and safety are everyone&#146;s
        responsibility &#150; at home, at school, and in the workplace. Before using
        equipment, students must be able to demonstrate knowledge of the equipment
        being used and the procedures necessary for its safe use. Personal protective
        gear should be worn as appropriate.</p> 
      <p>Classroom practice and the learning environment should comply with
        relevant municipal, provincial, or federal health and safety legislation,
        including the following:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li> the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act </li> 
        <li> the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) </li>        
        <li> the Food and Drug Act </li> 
        <li> the Health Protection and Promotion Act </li> 
        <li> the Ontario Building Code </li> 
        <li> the Occupational Health and Safety Act </li> 
        <li> local by-laws </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>Teachers must make use of a wide range of available and relevant
        resources to make students sufficiently aware of the importance of health and
        safety. These can include materials from the following:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li> Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) </li> 
        <li> Industrial Accident Prevention Association (IAPA) </li> 
        <li> Ontario Ministry of Labour (MOL) </li> 
        <li> Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS) </li> 
        <li> appropriate safe workplace associations (SWAs), such as the
          Construction Safety Association of Ontario (CSAO), the Ontario Service Safety
          Alliance (OSSA), the Transportation Safety Association of Ontario (TSAO), the
          Electrical Utilities Safety Association (EUSA), and the Workers&#146; Health
          and Safety Centre (WHSC), and clinics, such as the Occupational Health Clinics
          for Ontario Workers. </li>

      <p>The achievement chart is meant to guide teachers in:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li> planning instruction and learning activities that will lead to the
          achievement of the curriculum expectations in a course; </li> 
        <li> planning assessment strategies that will accurately assess
          students&#146; achievement of the curriculum expectations; </li> 
        <li> selecting samples of student work that provide evidence of
          achievement at particular levels; </li> 
        <li> providing descriptive feedback to students on their current
          achievement and suggesting strategies for improvement; </li> 
        <li> determining, towards the end of a course, the student&#146;s most

          his or her course work; </li> 
        <li> devising a method of final evaluation; </li> 
        <li> assigning a final grade. </li>

        <li> assessing their own learning; </li> 
        <li> planning strategies for improvement, with the help of their
          teachers. </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>The achievement chart provides a standard province-wide method for
        teachers to use in assessing and evaluating their students&#146; achievement. A
        variety of materials is being made available to assist teachers in improving
        their assessment methods and strategies and, hence, their assessment of student
        achievement.</p> 
      <p>The ministry is providing the following materials to school boards for
        distribution to teachers:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li> a standard provincial report card, with an accompanying guide </li> 
        <li> instructional planning materials </li> 
        <li> assessment videos </li> 
        <li> training materials </li> 
        <li> an electronic curriculum planner </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>When planning courses and assessment, teachers should review the
        required curriculum expectations and link them to the categories to which they
        relate. They should ensure that all the expectations are accounted for in
        instruction, and that achievement of the expectations is assessed within the
        appropriate categories. The descriptions of the levels of achievement given in
        the chart should be used to identify the level at which the student has
        achieved the expectations. Students should be given numerous and varied
        opportunities to demonstrate their achievement of the expectations across the
        four categories. Teachers may find it useful to provide students with examples
        of work at the different levels of achievement.</p> 
      <p>The descriptions of achievement at level 3 reflect the provincial
        standard for student achievement. A complete picture of overall achievement at
        level 3 in a course in technological education can be constructed by reading
        from top to bottom in the column of the achievement chart headed &#147;70-79%
        (Level 3)&#148;.</p>
