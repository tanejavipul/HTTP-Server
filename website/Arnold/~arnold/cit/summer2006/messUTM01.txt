Welcome to the Summer 2006 UTM session of Computing Insights for Teachers.

You are receiving this email because you registered for the ADVANCED session of CIT 2005.

1) The first thing I would like to do is draw your attention
   to the UTM CIT website. This is located at 

   http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~arnold/cit/

   This website contains UTM specific questions and answers (FAQ).
   You may be particularly interested in directions, location, 
   what we covered last year, the online quiz etc...

2) This year, we have some individuals coming to CIT from some distance.
   They are interested in sharing accommodations in on of our UTM apartments.
   A 2 bedroom apartment is available for $125/day, a 4 bedroom apartment is
   available for $154/day. Please let me know asap if you are interested 
   in sharing one of these.

3) PARKING IS FREE AT UTM!! Just so you know, we don't make a big deal about
   this, but at $15/day (ie Intro session), this could significantly increase
   the cost of attending CIT.

   How do you get free parking? Well, just send me (email me) the
   make, model and license for the car you will be parking at UTM. I will
   send you a parking pass which you can use to park for free at UTM.


Looking forward to seeing you this summer!

Please contact me if you do not wish to attend the Advanced CIT section.
