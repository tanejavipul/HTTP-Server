<h3>General Marking Scheme</h3>

<h3>Marking Scheme</h3>
<table border>
<tr><th>Mark</th><th>What you did</th></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><b>Reason, apply, problem solve, present:</b> 
	Correctly applies ideas to reach a clear, concise, correct, cleanly presented solution. Can reason 
	about ideas presented. Can apply them to different settings. etc. Minor technical flaws allowed.
	Your explanations/documentation is clear and simple, gets to the point, presents the right few
	concepts necessary to understand the solution.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>As in 5 but lacks some clarity, not as concise as possible, some minor flaw, not a clean presentation.
	Documentation/explanation is not focused, does not address key points
	in any special way.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td>
<td>
<b>Semantics:</b> Demonstrates correct understanding of basic definitions, ability to correctly apply basic techniques,
theorem statements etc. Some major conceptual misunderstanding. Indicators are that fixing the problem would require a long discussion.
<tr><td>2</td><td>Some major flaw in the understanding of basic definitions, techniques, theorem statements.
Examples are: Applies theorems to wrong settings. 
Does not understand the goal (ie tries to prove the wrong result).
Solves the wrong problem.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><b>Syntax: </b>Ability to restate given definitions, theorems, techniques.</td></tr>

<h3>Marking Scheme (Applied to Karate)</h3>
<table border>
<tr><th>Mark</th><th>What you did</th></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><b>Reason, apply, problem solve, present:</b> 
	Can use the block effectively during kumite (fight). 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td>
<td>
<b>Semantics:</b> Can actually block a punch with knowledge of the type of punch to be thrown and the blocking technique to be used.
	Can explain different aspects of the block and why they are relevent.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><b>Syntax: </b> Moves in a fashion similar to the instructor to demonstrate a block.  </td></tr>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<ul>
<li> You can improve your mark by recognizing what you <b>do not know</b> this may sound strange. For example,
if you know that your proof is incorrect, please say in what way it is. If you recognize that you can not complete
the proof, please state that and why, what you would need to do to complete it. etc. 
<li> If you write up a proof with a major flaw <b>and</b> do not know that you  have a major flaw, 
this shows a larger gap in understanding
than if you recognize the flaw.
<li> Be concise and clear, we will associate this with you understanding what the important points are and
focusing on them. This means that you can think critically about what you are doing and
assess its value etc. That you have a solid understanding of the problem capture ideas and present them.
