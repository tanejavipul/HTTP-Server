   Breakfasts (muffins, coffee etc.) outside CCIT2140 at 9:45 M-F

   and

   the second link has LOT 4 and the CCIT building highlighted
   but is an older map. You will probably park in LOT 4 and then
   make your way through the South Building to the CCIT
   building. People do get lost inside the South Building though.

4) Sessions will be held from 10-4 (with breakfast at 9:45 and lunch
   at 1 outside CCIT2140).
