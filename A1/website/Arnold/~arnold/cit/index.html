	<h2>What is Computing Insights for Teachers?</h2>
	<p>
	Computing Insights for Teachers is an intensive one-week workshop sponsored by the University of Toronto's Department of Computer Science. It is intended to give high school teachers the tools to teach Java effectively, which is important since Java is the object-oriented programming language favoured by the Advanced Placement Program.. 
	</p>
	<p>
	This workshop discusses examples and projects for high school computer science classes, including self-paced units, assignments, class exercises, and projects. This workshop is also a forum for computer science teachers from all over Ontario to gather, exchange ideas, and develop new approaches for teaching. 
	</p>

	You can find some educators comments about CIT at UTM <a href=citComments.html>here</a>.

		<!-- <a href=cit.html>This summers sessions are described here.</a> -->
<!-- 
	<li> <b>Topics covered in summer2002:</b>
		<p>
		We will essentially cover the <a href=cit2001Contents.html>CIT 2001</a> topics, with an additional focus
		on applets. 
		<p> As well, depending on interest, we will have parallel sessions devoted 
		to a select few advanced topics. Suggested topics (only a few will be covered) 
		include network programming, advanced problem solving, client/server applications, 
		multithreaded applications, servlets, recursion, proofs of correctness, 
		what is computability, 
		what is complexity etc. Feel free to suggest some.

<xmp>
Each day when they arrive they can pick up their passes from the attendant in 
the Lot 4 booth and proceed to park in either lots 2, 4, 8, or 9. Please keep 
in mind the permits are issued for single day use only so they will have to do 
this each morning. 

The permits need to be displayed clearly in their dash. 
</xmp>

		</ul>
	<li> What will a typical day look like?
		<ul>
		<li> We go from 10-4.
		<li> Lectures and labs will be intermixed throughout the day.
			This will give you a chance to immediately work on
			presented concepts.
		<li> Lectures will take place in the lab. This will give me a chance to ask questions
			and together work on the solutions. 
		<li> There will be coffee and muffins for breakfast (9:45 outside CCIT2140)
			as well as lunch 1-2 (outside CCIT2140).
		</ul>
	<li> Am I prepared?
		<ul>
		<li> Please see the online <a href=Quiz.html>Quiz</a>. If you find that you
			can solve all of these problems using the language of your choice,
			then you are ready for the Introductory session. If you can solve these
                        using Java, then you are ready for the Advanced (UTM) session.
                        Some of them may be difficult.
		<!-- 
		<li> <b>Note:</b> This Advanced CIT will focus more on problems, so we will spend some
                        time with a basic Java review.
		-->

		<li> If you have difficulty, or are not comfortable with procedures,
			if statements, loops, expressions etc. Please contact the instructor for the Introductory session.
