<h1>2014 ideas</h1>
<ul>
<li> Turn our collection fo mobile phones into mobile mobile phones. Add wheels, controller circuitry
	and let them drive themselves around. Mobile phones to robots.
<li> One graphic/day. Use CS, mine data and come up with intersting charts, similar to http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/. Example: Voroni diagram of McDonalds and of Hospitals.
<li> Rewrite my TA application system using Ajax. I have been meaning to do this.
<li> Twitter mining and understanding. Mine tweets, understand something about the social network, for example,
	understand the spread of ebola.
<li> Use our linux labs (60 systems) together to solve some interesting, difficult problems. 
<li> Improve my iris recognition code. This is a machine learning/computational vision problem.
<li> Write Javascript that understands what part of a web page the user is reading and reports back to central server. Understand how 
	organizations are already doing this...

Parallel Algorithms and their implementation,  Jun Sasaki, Summer 2002
	1) Understand the field of parallel algorithms
	2) Understand the MPI (Message Passing Interface). An application
	   programming interface allowing 'simple' expression of parallel
	   algorithms using a network of computers.
	3) Implement parallel algorithms using MPI in our lab of 40 computers for
	   a) Numerical algorithms (heat flow equation)
	   b) Solution of combinatorial problems (Hamiltonian Path)
	4) Analyze the results produced in 3 above
	
	
Face Recognition,   Ravinder Mann, Fall 2003
	
	(Write software which can) recognize a sample face from a set of given faces.
	Use of Principal Component Analysis [Using Eigenface approach].
	Use a simple approach for recognition and compare it with Eigenface approach .
	Suggest which one is better and why. It may happen that in some cases
	latter may work better than former approach and vice versa.
	
	
OpenGL on the GameBoy Advance,  Daniel Zabawa, Spring 2004
	To implement a basic 3-dimensional renderer for use on the Nintendo GameBoy Advance(tm).
	To achieve an acceptable level of performance, then extend the feature set as far as possible.

	There are three main goals here.
	First, to gain insight into the 3d graphics pipeline at the lowest level,
	and it's design and implementation issues. Second, to undertake an exercise in optimization,
	in terms of both speed and memory, at both high and low levels.
	Finally, to learn an unfamiliar system intimately, and hopefully gain insight in the
	process of learning other systems efficiently.
	
Vehicular Signal Acquisition and Processing,  James McCrae, Summer/Fall 2004
	The development of a computer system which is physically connected to
	the sensors of the vehicle's motor to acquire signals. Also, the development
	of a software solution to acquiring and processing the data from the connection.
	Finally, an open exploration into the relevance and potential for this system -
	and Computer Science in automotive technology.
	
(GoBlue) Cellphone based e-commerce solution,  Shadid Haque and Sazzad Kamal, Summer/Fall 2004
	Working with industry (Nokia, Rogers wireless, and Moneris electronic billing solutions)
	we develop a complete e-commerce solution. The front end for this application
	is the customers cellphone. This will allow customized and quick access to
	store services.

Voice XML and Multimodal Browsers,  Farhang Farid, Fall 2004
	A new breed of web browsers is emerging, those that can understand a users
	voice and synthesize speech. We explore web based applications using
	these multimodal browsers and the emerging standard used to specify them
	(XML+V).
	
	The final application developed with this technology is a voice enabled media player.
	This device allows its user to request (by voice) the creation of song playlists
	and their execution (play, stop, etc.). Basically, a voice enabled IPOD.
	
Volumetric Rendering,  Andy Chow,  Philips Benjamin, Rahil Ashraf, Fall 2004
	supervised jointly with Virgis Barzda (Physics)
	The physics department has legacy research software (Mu) and hardware (VolumePro 500).
	Mu+VolumePro500 allow the physics department to display and explore three dimensional
	volumetric data obtained from some of their microscopes. To continue advancing their
	explorations, they have purchased the VolumePro1000. Our goal is to understand and
	document the Mu software, the new VolumePro1000, port Mu to the new hardware
	and add additional features to Mu. These new features include the ability to
	manipulate and display multiple channels of volumetric data.
	
Artificial Intelligence on the Cellphone,  Sazzad Kamal, Spring 2005
	To make a game for cell phones that learns from experience. Sazzad Kamel implemented a version of TicTacToe
	that learns from playing either the cellphone user or another TicTacToe strategy. The novel
	aspect of this project is that strategies can visit and play other strategies on other cellphones.
	They can then return to the original cellphone, having learned from the experience.
	
Download Manager Sorter,  Daniel Kozimor, Fall 2005
	This project received a $2000 award from the OSOA Student Experience Program.
	
	Contribute to the open source web browser Firefox. Daniel added logical and
	physical sorting abilities to the Mozilla Download Manager.
	
The Complexity of Games,  Stefan Gueorguiev and Omar Beidoun, Fall 2005
	This research project investigates the computational complexity of some simple
	games and puzzles. As well as understanding the complexity classes P, NP, P-SPACE,
	and the relation to each other, the students investigated proofs of NP-completeness
	and P-Space- completeness for some common games and puzzles. Finally, the students
	investigated the computational complexity of some new puzzles.
	
Occluder Light Suppression and Large Screen Displays,  Adrian Balaura and Ryan Figueiredo, Fall 2005
	This project received a $2000 award from the OSOA Student Experience Program.
	
	Students developed a system to determine if there is a foreign object located between a data projector
	and the projection surface. Once an object is found, the system will modify the projection to
	exclude that object.
	
	One practical use of this extension is to avoid projecting in the eyes of presenters
	when they stand in front of their presentations.
	
	The second part of this project develops a multi-projector, high resolution, large
	screen display. This allows two projectors to be used to, together, display a single
	high resolution image.
	
Introduction to Information Security,  Farhang Farid, Fall 2005
	An investigation into aspects of information security. The report covers
	the history of cryptography and system security with some investigation
	into software security (buffer overruns and integer overflows).
	
Actionstep: Porting Openstep to Flash,  Scott Hyndman, Spring 2006
	This project received a $2000 award from the OSOA Student Experience Program.
	
	Macromedia's Flash engine has a limited set of widgits (textboxes, dropdown list boxes,
	tables etc.) used to create Graphical
	User Interfaces. The Actionstep open source project addresses this issue by implementing the OpenStep
	Application Kit in ActionScript (so making the OpenStep Application Kit available
	to developers of Flash applications). For his project, Scott developed a major portion
	of the codebase of this open source project.
	
Clubs Management Software,  Arvand Owji, Spring 2006
	Arvand developed a web based Student Club management system. This system
	(based on PHP) provides clubs the ability to manage their members,
	advertise events, register students in events and manage student
	payments for events.
