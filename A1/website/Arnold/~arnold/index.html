	<li> Some thoughts/sayings of mine:
<xmp>
1) Do something, something happens. Do nothing, nothing happens.
2) Wisdom is where you find it. Happiness is where you find it.
3) If you have not failed three times before lunch, you are not trying hard enough.
4) Having a brain is not easy. Having two is next to impossible.
5) Indifference is the true mark of confidence.
6) Never miss an opportunity to do the right thing.
7) To become an expert, repeat until it is easy.
8) An expert knows how to apply minimal effort for maximum effect.

	<li> General note to students in my classes: You might think that my online lecture notes are incomplete, this is done deliberately. 
		I expect that students will use what I provide
		as scaffolding and complete them with details and discussion that happen in class and the references. Additionally, your own personal thoughts
		when filling in details are important. You might think of something in a slightly different way than someone else. Your own reminders are important.
		I have taught much of what my department has to offer in the way of courses. I do have complete notes. When I stand up in front
		of the class, my goal is not to present material, but to convey concepts to people, to demonstrate how a person puts together concepts to solve problems.
		This is why I come in with a problem, write code, explore, make mistakes, fix them, explore students suggestions etc.
		It would be much easier for me to simply present a 'solution', but far less useful. I want you to be the person that can get from the
		problem to the solution. The solution is not the answer. When we are in the same room together, take advantage of it.
		Ask questions, stop me, ask the person next to you what they think etc. If you don't understand, then chances are others do not as well!
		Your goal at University is to learn, don't let your ego get in the way of that. Remember, a text book does not understand anything,
		videos are not the same as a lecture, they each have their pros and cons, take advantage of each medium.

I was reading about the recently-released PS3 exploit USB key:

Plugging in the USB key emulates a 6-port USB hub then connects/disconnects devices 
with spoofed descriptors (which are the payload for the
exploit) to smash the heap and overwrite the call to free() so when the device 
authentication fails, it returns into the middle of the payload.

Truly one of the most elegant hacks I've ever had the pleasure of understanding :)

Google's Rob Pike demoed a new programming language called Go a couple
of days ago, looks pretty interesting.  In particular, the
communication channels (through which you can pass other channels).
The client/server demo (around 40:00 in the youtube video) shows off a
simple multiplexed server which makes use of channels (the request
simply contains the response channel that the server should write to).
Cool!

There will be a "Home Made" PEY Info Session directed towards MCS students. The goal for this
session is to provide more real and personal information about MCS PEY experiences. This
session will mainly be for the 1st and 2nd year students who are interested in the program as
well as the 3rd years who are preparing to go out next year.

The main attraction will be the appearances of students who just returned from PEY and
internships. They will be sharing how the process really works in detail and what the students
can expect mainly in terms of:
**The types of jobs offered and how to decipher what job descriptions really mean
**How interviews work
**Anything else they feel is relevant. :)

There will also be time for question and answers.

WHEN: Thursday, Octobre 8th, 2009 @ 5:15pm
WHERE: Student Centre Room 280 (Across from the Board Room)

Food/Refreshments will be provided for the event.

	<li> What I told my CSC148 (Introduction to Computer Science) students after they completed the course...
<blockquote>
You may think that you have feedback from 148. That the mark
you have is a full characterization of your first year experience.
The real picture is a bit more complicated than that. The average
student comes into CSC148 with a few disadvantages. Most of the
work you have had to do in the past was scaffolded for you. Much
of what you produced in the past had little meaning. My goal in CSC148 was to
change that. To let you know that 'there is something to understand',
to give you an opportunity to know when you understood something,
to let you see that there was something you could do about a problem,
that you could assert yourself. Solving problems is not easy, but this
is OK. The fact that you may have been ill prepared for this is irrelevant.
The fact that you took up the challenge and came out the other side
with a changed attitude, with a new frame of reference,
knowing when you don't understand and knowing that you can do something
about it. This is the most important part of your first year experience.

I saw the start of this change in many of you. Making this change is difficult,
it involves your participation (remember how I tried to get all of you
involved in class investigations!). It involves your effort and motivation
(some of you really cared whether your TreeDict performed well). The process
is messy. I did not want to lay everything out for you, instead, I wanted
you to have to look around, think critically, investigate. I chose to
come to class with problems 1/2 solved and then investigate them with you,
so you could see the reality of a human investigating a problem.

From now on, you are an active participant in the game of life. You
can change your brain. Whether you know it or not, this is the change
I saw in most of you. The abilities you will have as a result of your
education are hard to come by but useful in the extreme.

I just wanted you to understand what happened to you in your
first year of University and why. See you next year!

		to pickup Microsoft Technologies (given that you know a related technology). Examples are ... "migrate from php to asp", or "java to c#".
	<li> Natasha also points out <a href=http://infoworld.com/d/developer-world/we-need-more-polyglot-programmers-678>an article in Info World</a>. 
		She wonders...
<blockquote>
The argument is that, often students are graduating with expertise in only one or two
languages and not enough variety in their programming language arsenal.  While it is
true that from a software engineering perspective, it's the more abstract skills that
will get you from design to ship-ready, how important do you think it is to pursue
breadth (of hands-on experience)  in the early stages of one's career?
</blockquote>
		I think that at UTM, we give students a firm foundation in 
		basic principles and then give students an opportunity to
		see that they can pick up new technologies. For example, 
		in CSC309, students are exposed to sockets and multithreadded programming in Java,
		Ajax applications (Javascript+PHP), perl, XSL, CSS, Servlets, JDBC and Postgresql. In some years, we have also done
		Midp, Android, ASP.NET (with VB), SQL Server. I believe that this is only possible 
		because we actually did get the foundations right.  We have it covered!

<p>
The Tweenbots unexpected presence in the city created an unfolding narrative that spoke not simply to the vastness of city space and to the journey of a human-assisted robot, but also to the power of a simple technological object to create a complex network powered by human intelligence and asynchronous interactions. But of more interest to me was the fact that this ad-hoc crowdsourcing was driven primarily by human empathy for an anthropomorphized object. The journey the Tweenbots take each time they are released in the city becomes a story of people's willingness to engage with a creature that mirrors human characteristics of vulnerability, of being lost, and of having intention without the means of achieving its goal alone. As each encounter with a helpful pedestrian takes the robot one step closer to attaining it's destination, the significance of our random discoveries and individual actions accumulates into a story about a vast space made small by an even smaller robot.

	<li> Adam (a team lead from CSC490 last term) has the following to say about working in groups.
<xmp>
Subject: Reflections on CSC490

Hi Arnold,

I realize it's been a while since we last spoke but my current experience in one of my
courses reminds me of when I took CSC 490 last year. If you can recall, I worked in a
group of twelve students on a web application for aggregating and delivering events.
This semester I'm taking the compilers course, CSC 488, but this time we're working in
groups of four.

I've found that groups of four are much more manageable and as a result, 1-2 hour
meetings are usually enough for everyone involved to resolve any issues or propose any
ideas they may have about the project. Whereas in a larger meeting, there are usually
only a few active participants and someone has to take up the task of playing "round
robin" to keep things going. This is usually what ended up happening not only in the 490
group meetings, but also in the team at IBM where I did my PEY; in both cases it made
the meetings seem not worthwhile for the majority of those attending.

Notwithstanding, working in a group as large as the one in 490 was a valuable and unique
experience. It was my first chance to take leadership of a large software team, and I
learned a lot of things about group management and project organization. I think that if
I were to relive the experience, I would try and divide the group into two or three
smaller teams, just as how I divided the larger project into several independent
sections.

Part of the problem with larger meetings was that many members had to stay and listen to
discussions not relevant to what they were working on. Smaller meetings would have let
each team focus on the component they were responsible for, and hopefully would have
reduced the problem of the few team members that slacked by making them more
accountable. Communication between groups could be facilitated by having a member of
another team sit in on each meeting, or by having one person attend all meetings to
ensure that individual teams remain coordinated. These meetings could then be followed
by less regular summary meetings in which each team presents their work so far to other
teams in the group, as a preparatory step to the monthly group presentations that were
done in class.

Managing a group of this size demanded most of the time I was able to devote to this
course, leaving not much time for any actual programming on my part. However, the size
of the group was a benefit here, since I could delegate all of the programming to the
programmers, and focus on keeping the team running. Alternatively, management duties
could have probably been divided equally between two people to allow them to have some
time for programming.

Another error I feel I had made was arbitrarily reassigning people to other sections of
the project. I felt that those team members had finished their task and that by moving
them to another section I could keep them interested in the project. Instead, it would
have been better to capitalize on the experience they already had from working in that
section by finding ways that they could improve or extend it. Moving a team member to
another division adds time overhead as the programmer must learn how to work with a new
code base and programming tools. I think I've learned that it's best to keep a
programmer in the same area unless he or she explicitly asks to work on something new.

Consequently, my experience at U of T has given me an unexpected, but welcome breadth of
opportunity to study how to effectively work in a large group. From being a programmer
on a team of ten at IBM, to leading a team of twelve, and finally to working as part of
a team of four; understanding every side of the process is key to becoming an effective
programmer.

Thanks and regards,

Hi Arnold,

I hope all is well. I graduated from UTM in June 2006 with majors in CS and Commerce. I
thought I would touch base with you and give you a heads up for your students regarding
a career information session being held Monday September 15 at 5:00pm down at St.
George. I am sure the career centre will have more information on the event. I will be
saying a couple words about my experience so far at IBM. There are a number of
positions both in CS and Consulting if you have any students interested in jobs. The
website to check out would be ibm.com/start.

If you could pass this along to any interested students that would be great.

	Shafique Virani	from The Department of Religion and Historical Studies have a potentially

<xmp>
There is a language known as Khojki that is almost extinct.  I've been
cataloguing and preserving the Khojki manuscripts and printed works
that have survived.  I'm looking for a student who could help to
research and design a Unicode font for typing in this script.  We
could even put forward a proposal to the Unicode consortium for this.
The script itself is quite logical and in many ways is similar to
Roman scripts like English.  However, one of the challenges a
programmer would face is that non-initial vowels are super-added to
consonant characters, not unlike what happens in South Asian
languages.  The second part of the project would be to train an OCR
reader to recognize the script.

The university's 492 class, or one of my Independent Studies classes,
may be an ideal forum in which a student could work on this project,
gaining course credit while at the same time learning a lot and adding
an unbeatable accomplishment to a resume.  I did advertise for
something like this in the current round of Research Opportunity
Program selections, but it fell under the rubric of Historical
Studies, and so I doubt very many computer science types would have
seen it.

	<li> Wayne points out...
<xmp>
Edward Lorenz, the discoverer of formal chaos with his early 1960's
paper on chaos in a simple 3D model of the weather (now called the
"Lorenz Equations" and resulting in the pretty figure called the
"Lorenz Butterfly"), died on 16 April this year.  However, he was also
a philosopher, and noted how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle,
coupled with the chaotic nature of complex physical systems, implies
the existence of strong non-determinism in the world, and thus
free will on a short timescale. An apt quote from his last book is,

    We must wholeheartedly believe in free will. If free will is a
    reality, we shall have made the correct choice. If it is not, we
    shall still not have made an incorrect choice, because we shall
    not have made any choice at all, not having a free will to do so.

	<li> Eugen makes the following points...
<xmp>
Just visited your website and saw some of the updates, it's so true. There is a lack of qualified people in the field
right now, good programmers are hard to dig out. I've dealt with companies who used outsourcing firms and they keep
coming back to local native-english speaking professionals, even if they charge a lot more.

Also, I know that you've been saying this for a long time but only now do I realize the importance of networking.
Many people in the cs program don't network enough in the fields that they want to go into. Volunteering, posting on
forums, freelancing, befriending big names in the industry, visiting conventions is very much worth it.

Undergrads tend to think that no one will talk to them but I found that it can't be further from the truth, people
higher up in the foodchain love ambitious university students because chances are that those same students will be
joining them up there in a few years and being good to them will pay off, especially if the undustry is not very big.
While working at RIM during PEY a few years back I ended up making friends with one of the most knowledgeable search
engine experts (almost by pure chance) and 2 years later another company in a similar field ended up offering me a
65k/year position pretty much fresh out of university on his word alone, they didn't even ask for a resume before the
interview.

As you said, the market is hot - but it's hard to get a job if no one knows that you are out there and companies get
too many resumes to just notice people. I just now realized that much easier it is to stand out amongst the grey mass
if you go out and talk with people. :)

By the way, freelancing in vertical markets is smoking right now. Most programmers on the internet have zero
self-discipline and companies that need specific stuff done fast are willing to pay a premium. :)

	<li> If anyone is interested, a recruiting company contacted me about a C++/Python position they have not been able to fill. 
	<li> Billy says 'I got the job!'. Seems like the market is hot!! I hear lots of the same from my CSC490 students. Startups, going back to PEY positions, people going to RIM, Microsoft, IBM, ...
	<li> Cameron points out the 'cool' <a href=http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=0H1zrLZwPjQ>Johnny Lee TED Talk on Wii Remote hacks</a>. Both the hacks and the comment about communicating results via youTube are interesting.
		<a href=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/People/johnny/projects/wii/>Here's the guy's project page</a> if people want more details on the source downloads.


	<li> For current UTMCS students: The following are some really good approaches to working at home
		<ul>
		<li> On your current system, run VMWARE. You can now create Windows and Linux Virtual Machines. Ubuntu is a good choice for Linux. We have licenses for Windows XP Pro.
		<li> Dual boot your machine (to run OSX/Windows/Linux)
		<li> Run Cygwin (runs under Windows, install X and openssh). This will allow you to easily connect to our lab systems (with real X windows). If you run Windows, you probably want cygwin installed in any case.
		</ul>

<xmp>
I graduated from UTM in XXX XXXXX. I recently got a job with XXXXXXXXX and I would like
to just let you know that people here were very impressed with my CS projects (such as Intelligent Scissor, Image
Mosaic, Background Detection and etc)  that I had done while taking your classes such as CSC 309/ 320. Even thou the
projects seemed very hard back when I was in University looking back at it right now they were great projects to work
on and the result were very impressive and I can say without a doubt they were the most exciting projects that I
worked on during university and even after I graduated. Thank you for your great assignments and classes it really
helped me advance my career.

	<li> Eric just sent an update (he has too many opportunities!!). Here is a piece of advice he left with me...
<xmp>
If there's one thing I've learned so far, it's to avoid writing code
which you "might need later", because you'll inevitably have to
rewrite or heavily modify it because the circumstances will almost
certainly have changed.  In other words, if something is
under-specified (which happens often), don't write it until you
actually need it.

	The conclusion...Ruby seems to be a nice compromise between OO and Functional programming.
	Ruby has a good list handling paradigm, code seems clearer than
	Java, but this is at the cost of type safety. Ruby just needs list
	comprehension like Python and Haskell.
	Ruby designers seem to have made some very good choices during language design.

	<li> Here is an interesting challenge: Using the language of your choice,
		write a program which allows two humans to play connect 4 
		against eachother.
		Your program should be text based, after each turn, display the 
		board and then ask for the next players move. Your program
		should understand the rules of the game. Your goal is to 
		create the shortest program possible.

Google and Specialized are searching for the brightest engineering
minds on earth for the first ever Innovate or Die Pedal-Powered
Machine Contest. I've also attached a poster that you can
forward along for promotion.

We're asking your students to invent and build environmentally
friendly, zero-emission machines that transform human pedal power into
a new and useful purpose. After they build it, they film it and post
it on YouTube by Sunday, December 15th.

The Grand Prize for the most innovative submission will be $5,000 and
a Specialized Globe bike for the winner(s).  The inventors behind the
top 5 runner-up inventions will also receive Specialized Globe Bikes.
This is an opportunity to flex your school's inventive muscle and have
some fun doing it. And perhaps even help save our planet, one pedal
stroke at a time.

	<li> <a href=http://cmu.edu/uls/journeys/>Randy Pausch's last lecture</a> and what Cameron had to say about it (below)
<xmp>
I definitely recommend people set aside some time to check it out. It's
fairly long (clocks in around a couple of hours,) but it's worth it. I
think anyone who watches it will walk away with some new insight on life,
careers, family, etc. and ways you can better yourself and others in
these areas. Just based on the lecture alone, you can tell Pausch has
enjoyed a great life, so the advice he provides on living carries a lot
of weight. This is further evident by the fact that he does not seem
overly worried or consumed by the fact that he is soon going to pass
away.. a sign I think that he has very little to no regrets in life. It
would be great if everyone could feel this way later on in life. In a
largely materialistic driven society, this lecture is a nice reminder
that there's more important things to life than making tons of money,

<xmp>
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE YEAR (PEY) INFO SESSION

For students who did not sign up for PEY in September and wished they had, now is their chance.  For the first time, PEY is
admitting 2nd and 3rd year students to the PEY program for the second round of job postings and interviews which will continue
to run until September.
 
An information session will be held at UTM on Thursday, March 22 in SE3129 from 11:00-12:00.  This is now listed on our events
calendar.  No advance sign up required.

A Resume and Cover Letter Session will be held by the PEY staff the following week for those who will be applying to the
program (Thurs Mar 29, 11:00-1:00, SE3140). 

PEY offers 12-16 month internships to students who are currently finishing 2nd or 3rd year. This program would be of great
interest to Computer Science students, as Computer Science and Engineering are the primary focus of the program, but Commerce
and Management students are also welcome to attend as there are usually a limited number of opportunities for these students. 
</xmp>

	<li> From a Washington Post article titled <i><a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/23/AR2007022301697.html>How to Keep America Competitive</a></i> by Bill Gates
<xmp>
This issue has reached a crisis point. Computer science employment is 
growing by nearly 100,000 jobs annually. But at the same time studies 
show that there is a dramatic decline in the number of students graduating
with computer science degrees.
</xmp>
	<li> From slashdot...<a href=http://www.startupping.com/>advice for those starting up</a>
	<li> Radek points out that <a href=http://code.google.com/soc/>Summer of code is on again!</a>
	<li> Mike points out some really cool 3-d face morphing (related to our csc320 project) at <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nice6NYb_WA&eurl=#>this link</a>

	<li> Microsoft will be at UofT Feb 21, 22 and needs resumes in by Feb 15th. See the <a href=jobs/msHiringOpportunity.txt>note</a>.
	<li> Greg Wilson points out this neat video about <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gmP4nk0EOE&eurl=

	<li> <a href=http://www.csgames.org>CS Games</a> are approaching, should we send a team?
<xmp>
The 5th CS Games are being held March 9-11, 2007, and the deadline to register
your team is FEBRUARY 1st!

The CS Games are an exciting North-American inter-university competition
directed at challenging and enhancing skills in the fields of Computer Science,
Computer Engineering, and Software Engineering. They pit the world's future
innovators against each other, in the spirit of friendly competition, with the
goal of providing them an excellent opportunity to develop both their technical
and social skills.

For your university to participate, all you need is a team of 7 to 10
undergraduate students interested in the areas listed above. Last year's event
was record-breaking, with 313 students hailing from 24 universities. We expect
this year to be no less exciting!
</xmp>
	<li> From Robert at CUTC...
<xmp>
As an aside, so far CUTC has been pretty good.  We just had the TechExpo and I
had the chance to talk to quite a few people at several companies (including
Microsoft and Nortel) and passed out my resume to a few of them too.
</xmp>

	<li> <a href=http://www.cutc.ca/2007/files/CUTC2007_DelegateGuide.pdf>CUTC</a> is happening Jan 11-13
		at the Hilton in Toronto. It is a great chance to network, get a taste of industry, see some interesting
		speakers. As well, we (UTMCS) will be funding $75/person for the first 20 UTM CS students attending.
		Please let me or Zia know asap if you are attending.
	<li> <a href=http://openmosix.sourceforge.net/>OpenMosix</a> 
		is a Linux kernel extension that turns a network of ordinary computers into a supercomputer for Linux applications.
        <li> You might be interested in a new course offered at UTM
                <b>CSC411 Machine Learning and Data Mining</b>.
                See <a href=http://databases.about.com/od/datamining/a/datamining.htm>What is Datamining</a>
                and <a href=http://www.cio.com/archive/051598/mining.html>CIO's perspective on Datamining</a>.
                <p>
                A description of the course can be found below,
                the field is relatively new, with many interesting results in the recent past
                and many new tools coming online that make use of them (SQL Server 2005 for example).
<p>
Machine learning research aims to build computer systems that learn from experience.
Learning systems are not directly programmed by a person to solve a problem, but instead
they develop their own program based on examples of how they should behave,
or from trial-and-error experience trying to solve the problem. These systems require
learning algorithms that specify how the system should change its behavior as a result of
experience. Researchers in machine learning develop new algorithms, and try to understand
which algorithms should be applied in which circumstances.
<p>
Machine learning is an exciting interdisciplinary field, with historical roots in computer
science, statistics, pattern recognition, and even neuroscience and physics. In the past 10
years, many of these approaches have converged and led to rapid theoretical advances
and real-world applications.
This course will focus on the machine learning methods that have proven valuable and
successful in practical applications. This course will contrast the various methods, with
the aim of explaining the circumstances under which each is most appropriate. We will
also discuss basic issues that confront any machine learning method.

<li> Your CSAE is organizing trips to CUTC and CUSEC, please register asap
	to get the earlybird rate. As well, the department will help fund your trip to
	the conference (details to appear).
	<p>Note from Zia follows...
<xmp>
Regarding CUTC, It would be great if you can post about it on your website.
Please give the link to this pdf file:

Hi everybody.

On Saturday, our teams competed in the ACM International
Collegiate Programming Competition regionals, and we won!

Our two teams took first and seventh places, beating
Waterloo and over 100 other teams from Ontario, and 3
US states. So if you see them in the halls, make sure to
congratulate them. They put in countless hours of practice.

Toronto 1: Sean Henderson, Frank Chu, Mohammad Moharrami.
Toronto A: Siavosh Benabbas, Devin Lui, Devon Liu.

The final scoreboard is here:

<li> A Puzzle:
<xmp>
A flower bed takes up an elliptical plot exactly 100 square feet in area.  It 
is bordered by a rock garden 4 feet wide, which is in turn surrounded by a path 
4 feet wide.

What is the area enclosed by the widest ellipse?

<xmp>
Hibernate is a powerful, high performance object/relational persistence 
and query service. Hibernate lets you develop persistent classes following 
object-oriented idiom - including association, inheritance, polymorphism, 
composition, and collections. Hibernate allows you to express queries in 
its own portable SQL extension (HQL), as well as in native SQL, or with an 
object-oriented Criteria and Example API.

<li> Atif says...
<xmp>
If I can pass one
piece of advice on to your  students it is never to do job just for
money... pick a career you like. If you love what you do, you will excel
no matter how difficult the challenge. If you hate your job, all the
money in the world will not make waking up in the morning meaningful.

Hello Arnold,

first of all I would like to say thank you for teaching a hands on web
development course. I learned a lot this semester and its been really
fun.

Now I had 4 interviews related to 309. Two for ASP and two for PHP. I
didn't get the job for the asp because, well we didn't learn it, even
thought I kept telling them I could learn it in a couple days, guess I
wasn't convincing enough. But good news is, I got one of the PHP jobs.
Doing web development php and mySQL online store type of thing called
osCommerce, from home on contract basis for the summer. Going great so
far, I like it a lot.

Sadly not a single JSP/servlets interview... So I began to wonder why
were so many people using PHP which seemed to lack all these fancy
features of java/asp. I asked during one of my interviews and the
answer I got was that PHP is open source, licencing is free.

There you go, teaching php this semester was a great idea it got me my
first DEVELOPMENT job and I am really happy about it. THanks again,
and see you on the exam.

CSAE (Computer Sceince Association at Erindale) is looking for the following 
positions to be filled for the next year 2006-07:

President
Vice President
Public Relations
Finance Director
IT Analyst
Events Coordinator
Internal Affairs
Marketing Director

The last three positions were introduced last year. Hence its important that 
we fill atleast the first 5 positions. Please email us at eccsae AT utm dot 
utoronto dot ca by March 15!!! with your Name, Student number and prefered 
email address. In the event that more than one person is interested in some 
position, we would resort to elections, though it hasnt happened in previous 
years(lol). Why should you consider becoming an exec:

- Networking, Networking, Networking....you probably have heard it many 
times from career centre. This would provide you with this oppurtunity
- You can put that on your resume and perhaps your resume wont go in that 
thrash bin
- when the employer ask you "describe a suitation where ......" perhaps you 
wont have to say "hmm haaan hmmmm", instead you would be able to talk about 
your CASE experience!!!!

Nathan Duthoit's presentation: AJAX

Abstract: "One of the main buzzwords in the web development community this 
year, AJAX is being seen as the next approach to web development. It is 
gaining popularity as it is being adopted by major players in the industry 
such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft. We'll see how AJAX works (using Google 
Suggest as an example), what are its main advantages and limitations and 
where this new approach is going."

Nathan Duthoit is a fourth year student at the University of Toronto at 
Mississauga working towards a Specialist in Computer Science, Information 
systems option.

Raheel Ashraf's presentation: Tapestry

Abstract: Nowadays there is a need for web frameworks that could allow 
developing dynamic, robust, highly scalable web applications easily in a 
short period of time. Tapestry is one such solution that is aimed at 
answering some of the issues and problems with creating web applications. In 
my presentation, I would discuss the ideas and concepts behind this 
framework and would demonstrate how it's different from other popular 
frameworks out their.

Re: Graduating Year, Summer and Internship Positions

Did you go to Career Information Days on the St. George Campus and meet a Microsoft employee at the
booth?  Did you give them your resume?  Well a funny thing happened to your resume on the way to
Microsoft.  It got stolen.  Seriously.  We know U of T is full of extremely talented students, but in
the war for college talent, we had no idea how cut throat things would be.  This hasn't happened
before on our watch.  Be flattered no Waterloo resumes have ever been stolen. 

We want to make sure that you are considered so please re-send your resume in soft copy to
UofTres@microsoft.com and we will look for appropriate positions for you! 

AND to make it a bit more compelling, we will be giving away an Xbox 360 to one lucky student who
submits their Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Engineering Science or Software Engineering
resume before November 1st.  The winner will get an Xbox delivered to them after the official release
date of November 22.

I can't wait to hear from you and good luck in winning the Xbox!

Hi Arnold,
<br/>
<br/>
I had to wait for at least two months before I started getting some kind of response from the employers after
applying to jobs. At the end of the half summer session I started applying to jobs posted at the UOfT career center
and monster.ca and it wasn't until beginning of August when i got few interviews (at Bell for Test Analyst, Infusion
for Jr .NET Developer, and one of them was from AzoogleAds for PHP Developer). Few days after the interview at
AzoogleAds I got the offer. I never ended up going to the Bell interview because it conflicted with Infusion at the
same time on Friday I remember. I tried to change the timings for the bell interview but they had only one spot left
at 1:00 on Friday at the same time as Infusion. I ended up going to the interview at Infusion (a bad decision on my
part because a week following the interview on Monday i  a got call from the HR Manager at Infusion telling me that
they going on a hiring frezee and plus the interview at bell was a direct referral from Omair Butt who at the time
was working at Bell).
<br/>
<br/>
The real world is great. Demanding but its great. At job you learn things at much faster pace. In real world you
can't delay things as you can delay an assignment at school and choose to do it three days before the due date.
Everyday you have responsibilities you must get them done as early as possible because new problems and tasks keep
piling up. Thou I still sometimes don't have much to do but things are slowly picking up as i get more
responsibilities.
<br/>
<br/>
As i mentioned before AzoogleAds is rapidly expanding. Everyday they are hiring new people and interviewing lots. I
would recommend who ever is looking for a job to visit their career center page
(http://www.azoogleads.com/az/new/careers.php?l=Toronto) and apply for jobs that appeal to you. They are looking for
few PHP programmers with MySQL experience. I would recommend anyone who has some exposer to PHP and knows JavaScript
through out, to apply. Thou its not listed in the job description but if you are familiar with AJAX and the MVC
model, you will have an edge over the other candidates because one of the projects they are hiring for right now is
based on these two concepts, the Model-Viewer-Controller and the AJAX programming paradigm. I remember reading on
your page that you are thinking of teaching MVC in 309 and I think it's a great idea.
<br/>

<br/>
Professor Arnold,
<br/>
<br/>
How are you? The fall session had started. I assume you must be busy with coordinating your courses. How did the CIT go this summer? I know, there was
a big interest among teachers in that and I saw good attendance there the day when I was there.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought I should email you to let you know what I have been doing last few months following my end of Summer school and my undergrad at UTM. A month
and half ago, i found a job opportunity at a small but rapidly grown company name AzoogleAds as a Jr. Developer. AzoogleAds is online Marketing and
Advertising company have been ranked number by media experts all around North America. They use to PHP5 and 4 for their in house software development,
services and customer products. My job is part programming and part development/management.  In nutshell, I am responsible for ensuring that daily
click reports and other reports are downloaded and fed into the database. I basically wrote a utility using PHP CURL library which downloads these
reports from a third party server as CSV, parse the files and feed them into the database automatically. We keep getting new reports and formats every
day so i have constantly adding and updating my script. Other than that i am also involved an other project and help other developers in minor
debugging, fixes, testing and and small functionalities time to time. Its a great position and the company is great in terms of pay and benefits. The
coworkers are also very helpful and friendly.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing that i have realized over past few months when I was initially applying for jobs is that you shouldn't very picky about what job
opportunities you get. What i mean to say is that there aren't too many jobs out there and you should seize anything that comes your way, be it
development, programming, testing, consulting or even desktop support. I would like to let my fellow graduate students who are looking for jobs and
students who will graduating next year and will be looking for that perfect development position they been dreaming of after graduation is that don't
limit yourself to just pure programming position. What I have noticed that people graduating from UofT computer science have a mentality that thay are
only good for development positions and anything which is not development is of lower grade and should not be considered. Other non development
positions like Consulting, Support, Testing, Customer Service and Technical writing are equally challenging, well paid and recognized. I remember
there was big discussion about whether a testing is worth considering for someone who graduated UofT or not. The thing we have to realize here is that
most of are fresh graduates with virtually minimum or no experience at all. Employers are not looking where you graduated from. In fact they are
looking for whether you can meet their demands and be an asset to the company and at the same time contribute to the company through ever spectrum not
just your technical skills. That's why they have such competitive and hard interview process. So, what ever opportunity that comes along your way you
should definitely consider it because once you are in the industry you will learn more about the inner working of that particular industry and over
all and will get more opportunities along the way and foresee new opportunities and can plan you future accordingly. But first you have to start
somewhere and so don't be afraid to start at the bottom level.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I must get back to work now. I constantly check your page and try to keep myself updated with news and development at UTM.

<li> Here is what Cameron says about learning PHP...
<xmp>
Hello!

I've recently started doing some PHP development and have been looking 
into the various new features available in PHP5 (improved OO features, 
exception handling, etc..) I've come across a lot of bad PHP sites, but 
recently I have come across http://www.zend.com/php5/index.php. You may 
want to share this with people interested in learning PHP (and more 
specifically, PHP5). For people new to PHP, I recommend reading some of 
the latter articles in the "Absolute Beginners" section (the beginning 
artcles aren't too informative for people with a decent amount of 
programming experience.) The beginners section also has some articles on 
design theory and patterns (and how they apply to PHP.) I also recommend 
checking out some the "In Depth" articles

I've also found a page for a PHP Unit Testing framework 
(http://www.phpunit.de/en/index.php). I haven't given this a try yet, 
but hope to test it out over the next week or two. Just from glancing 
over the webpage, it appears to have a similar structure to JUnit and 
CPPUnit.

<li> Here is what Sajid said about 309 and work...
<xmp>
Hi,
  I am working for a company who wanted me to design a
beauty equipment website for them.  They wanted a web
site which will be easy for them to maintain.  So I
gave them what they wanted.  I designed a website,
using servlets and database.  It was very similar to
the CBC website project that we had worked on. 
Basically, whenever the company wants to update the
webpage they will just go on the control website where
they will be able to add and remove information out of
the pages.  I used JDBC, to add and remove all the
pictures from the data base, and used CSS, XML, and
XSL to design the outlook of the page.  

Your courses really give us a boost and experience
which prepare us for the real world.  Keep up the good
work.
</xmp>
<li> Below is what a couple of UTMCS alumni had to say about my Advice to a student on taking a tester position (also below)...
<xmp>
I was just checking out your website and I saw your note about taking a
tester position.  I agree with you 100% with this statement.  As you know, I
started out on a 6 month contract with COMPANY X as a Database Analyst.  
I left X to pursue a full time permanent position at COMPANY Y as
a QA Analyst.  What was worse was, they had me do manual software testing.
The work consisted of mindless clicking that anyone who can read could have
done.  I had experience creating automated test scripts and assumed they
would put me on the Automated test team so it would have been a little more
interesting.  I was going to use this as a foot in the door to get into
consulting.  I ended up hating it so much I
came back to X.  Right before I took the QA position, my
old manager at a previous company I worked for as a tester during my summers even
tried to talk me out of it.  From my personal experiences, I would suggest
avoiding ALL software testing positions period.  Since I had the software
testing experience as a student, I found when I graduated, that was the only
position anyone wanted to give me.  I was really fortunate to be able to
return to X.  I'm currently fulfilling a 1 year contract here, doing the
same work as before, but I do find it interesting at least.  Being on a
project team, there are new problems everyday that I am asked to solve using
Access and Excel Macros.  I found it quite fascinating how much can actually
be done in Access and Excel.  Anyways, hope all is well with you.  
</xmp>
<b> And a response to the above from yet another UTMCS student...</b> 
<xmp>
I've been reading some of the discussion on your webpage re: software
testing positions, and I thought I'd share my opinion on the subject.
I'm basing my opinion on your initial comment and the recent comment
from a former UTM student.
                                                                                                            
I think it's wrong to completely avoid all software testing positions. I
think it's the responsibility of the student to ask questions during an
interview to find out what type of testing a company actually does and
the type of testing the individual will be doing. That is, know what
you're getting into. There are many different styles of testing (unit
testing, acceptance testing, regression testing, GUI testing, etc..)
Even each specific category has it's own style. I don't think software
developers should settle for positions which involve them simply reading
over a list of requirements and clicking some buttons here and there to
make sure some system conforms to the requirements in front of them. For
example, if a position says an individual will be involved in writing
acceptance tests, find out if it is simply a matter of following a set
of instructions or whether it involves writing code and test suites
(using FitNesse, for example.) I don't think there's anything wrong in
accepting a testing position if it involves coding. A testing position
which occurs more on the development side than on the user/business side
can give good insight into the development cycle and code base. This
extra insight can help prepare you for a transition to development.
However, I do not think a developer should accept this type of role for
the rest of their life (unless this is what they want.) If they wish to
become more involved in the development process, they should express
this interest and take initiative (in the form of extra work, side
projects, etc..) If you prove to your team that you can be a valuable
asset to any development project, you will most likely become more
involved in such a project and perhaps eventually become a full time
development member.

So in summary, I just wanted to say:
        - Ask questions during interviews to find out exactly what
you'll be doing in a job.
        - Learn exactly what testing is and what it can often involve.
Find out about different styles of testing, etc.. If you're unfamiliar
with testing, try joining an open source project at
http://sourceforge.net/index.php or somewhere else just to get a feel
for it.)
        - Don't accept a testing position as a long-term job. Use it to
build a foundation you can use to move onto something more involved with
development.
                                                                                                            
I know a lot of people have difficulties finding their ideal jobs after
graduation and often settle for these type of positions. People reading
this in their 2nd or 3rd year should seriously consider taking PEY to
increase their chances of getting the job they want after graduating.

</xmp>

<b>And another response</b>

<xmp>
Arnold, I do agree with you whole-heartedly but I don't necessarily agree 
with the UTMCS Alumni who suggested to avoid ALL software testing positions 
period. It's all about doing the right things and doing the things right. A 
new graduate has to take every opportunity he/she comes across and to use 
their good judgment. To do the right thing is to asses an opportunity^Òs 
prospects and with careful planning can lead to something better. During an 
interview ask what industry standard/de facto technologies will you be 
using? Will you be working within a team-based, collaborative environment? 
Will there be opportunities to move around within the company? Will this 
experience prove to be valuable within a particular vertical industry? etc. 
To do the things right once you are hired is to extend your experiences by 
taking other opportunities that you were not initially hired for and  to 
improve the business within the company as you were suggesting i.e. Be 
proactive.

Here's a concrete example why no new grad should avoid all testing positions 
without at least assessing the opportunity: A QA Analyst can interact with 
the development and architecture team to define test plans to ensure that 
business requirements are met. The QA may create a test harness for the 
exploration and measurement of performance and scalability of web 
applications using load/stress testing tools such as Empirix eTester. The QA 
may be exposed to writing test cases for functional/regression testing and 
automated black-box testing using Mercury Interactive automation tools like 
Test Director, Win Runner, and Load Runner which are industry de facto 
testing tools. My previous company hired new grads with comp sci / 
engineering backgrounds and this is essentially what they were exposed to 
do. Fortunately, I was hired to do enterprise development as they threw me 
into the lions den i.e. the learning curve was steep during the first 6 
months. However, I have seen new grads with comp sci/eng from both QA and 
even Graphic Design who moved to development. An engineer doing graphic 
design you ask? In today^Òs saturated industry, new grads cannot afford to 
simply dismiss anything without having a second thought. A QA can definitely 
lead to junior development roles and subsequent higher level jobs such as 
junior performance engineer/analyst which are in demand in the financial and 
telecommunication industries. The PE would essentially improve the behavior 
of software as is it being developed i.e. response time optimization, I/O 
tuning, caching, application server tuning and performance testing by 
applying testing methodologies with emphasis on improving and ensuring 
optimal application performance and memory consumption characteristics in 
addition to all the things a QA would do as I^Òve mentioned above.

There was a new response in your website. He was essentially saying the same 
thing and I totally agree. I hope I have shed some light to the students.

Original advice...
<b>Advice to a student on taking a tester position...</b>
	<p>
	Please DO NOT be satisfied with a tester position (even if you take it initially). 
	You are far more than that. You are at least a developer
	out of UTM and more after. Take opportunities to show the company that you can
	develop, write testing software even though they don't ask for it etc.
	Look around for other opportunities to improve their business, even if
	they don't ask, take opportunities to be in on meetings etc.

<li> If you are interested in working on a game, funded by the department, please contact me.
<li> Some things I am working on this summer (clearly, this is too much for one person, 
	so definitely not all of it will happen). I post this to hear some of your thoughts...
	<ul>
	<li> REDO THIS WEBPAGE!!!
	<li> Obtained utmcs.net, I want to use this as a mechanism to keep former students in contact
		with our current students and UTM. The goal is to let students know what works, 
		where they are headed (I have lots of email from former students saying...we did the right thing here,
		the wrong thing there), present possible
		opportunities for employment, opportunities for previous students to give us updates on industry
		and the connection to what you learn at UTM. It can also be setup to allow students
		to post online resumes, code examples and applications.
	
		<p>Here is one of the things I was thinking when I reserved utmcs.net...
		When I trained in Karate, I saw the blackbelts in class. Even if I did
		not understand what in particular the days training was going to accomplish, 
		I knew the quality of students that resulted from the training. Unfortunately,
		you do not have this advantage as a student in University. That is, once students
		at UTM are through the program they leave and  you no longer have them as role models.
		I hope (if I have time/help) to develop utmcs.net to reconnect students with 
		their peers.
		<p> Work to be done here is to setup a webserver and Wiki or some other software,
		contact former students. 
	<li> Look into obtaining funding for some UTM projects (Microsoft, Eclipse grant from IBM, ITCDF, NSERC)
	<li> Move everyone in 3rd year to Eclipse and expose everyone to VS.NET, C#, introduce 
		subversion and Trac for project management.
	<li> Write description for two new courses: 1) Computer Security (software, system, network, cryptography) and
		2) Game Programming (how to, graphics, story lines, engines, programming a particular
		platform XBox?). I will probably have some csc493 students work with me on the first
		incarnations of these courses (interested?)
	<li> Running <a href=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~arnold/cit/>Computing Insights for Teachers</a>, I typically need some help with this!!
	<li> Prepare for the first offering of csc407 at UTM. Since it is being offered concurrently
		with csc309, we may tie some aspects of the courses together (see J2EE and Design Patterns (Thanks Farhang for the reference))
	<li> Collaboration with CCIT on a music related application. There is a possibility for a csc492 project here.
	<li> Collaboration with Physics on the development of a microscope and viewing software.
	<li> Take on a few contracts, or give them to some of our exceptional students. I have already
		passed some on to some of you. 
	<li> Thinking about Problem Solving sessions, Tech Sessions and a Technology Group for 
		first term. The Technology Group will be a group of students and faculty that meet
		each week to discuss Computer Science and Technology. Each week, one or two 
		members of the group will discuss/investigate some topic. Interesting topics (on the applied end) include:
		J2EE, Struts/Servlets/JavaFaces/Tapestry, Aspect Oriented Programming (AspectJ), how to use Trac and subversion,
		an indepth tutorial on Eclipse, XMLBeans, Hibernate, writing test suites, .NET (and languages), MS Access,
		programming MS Application (ie Word, Excel), Web Services, 
		a contest: Microsoft vs Java for a particular application, a review
		of a complete real world project and how it was done...
	<li> I am also exploring a few technologies and deciding whether to introduce them to 309...
		what do you think (something would have to be removed from 309, what?)?
<xmp>
Management:
  - All assignments submitted via CVS or Subversion
  - All projects maintained on Trac
  - Use of Eclipse encouraged (for the Java sections)

Course Content (will need to remove something):
  - Adding Struts+Hibernate to the Servlets section (not Tapestry, not Java Faces)
  - Some exposure to SOAP and Web Services
  - Exposure to Microsoft technologies

<li> Google has introduced its <a href=http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html>Summer of Code</a> program, why not try it!!
<li> <b>Comments on the difficulty of my courses ...</b>
	<p>
	The courses I taught you at UTM are difficult, the result of this
	is confidence. You know you can get through my courses, you know how
	to research and understand problems and tools, you know how to work 
	on large projects in a group, you have produced software you can 
	be proud of, you have real experience with current concepts and tools.
	You understand the theory and its application in the real world.
	I know, I was out in the 'real world' before comming back to UofT. 
	<p>
	You should know that, while I set high standards, I do try to help
	students achieve. My goal is not to fail students, but, ideally, to produce 
	students that understand at a high level. I feel that our approach
	should be to set the bar high and then do everything we can to 
	help students get over the bar.
	<p> 
	By setting high standards, I have tried to lay a fertile ground for you. 
	The students that passed through my courses before you are capable. 
	The result is that employers know UTM as a source for exceptional employees.
	UTM has a great reputation across the campuses and in industry. 
	This helps you, this helps the students that come after you.
	<p>
	I could show you a mailbox full of comments students have sent me after 
	going through my courses. All say that I did the right thing, you don't want 
	University to be easy, you want it to mean something, and it does.
	<p>
	At the end of the day, I need to know that you understand the material. 
	In a perfect world, the mark that you
	get in the course reflects your demonstration of this understanding.
	We try as hard as we can to achieve this.

	<p>Here is what Bilal had to say about attending CUTC
<xmp>
Hi Arnold,

As a result of attending CUTC, I had a chance to engage in a conversation with Alice Thomas, 
the VP of E-Business Solutions for CGI.  She mentioned that CGI would be hiring a bunch of 
new grads during the summer months and because of her insight, I paid close attention to 
their website, applying to almost 10 new positions each week during April and May.  If I had passed
on the opportunity to attend the conference, I would have never known about the opportunities at CGI, 
and as a result, wouldn't of been hired.  I *HIGHLY* recommend 3rd and 4th year students to attend 
the conference.

Regards,

Billal

<xmp>
If you know anyone who doesn't know how to pay (i.e. they lost 
the link in the original email sent after registration), just go to 
http://www.cutc.ca/2005/delegates/registration/payment.php?confirm=#### 
where #### is their delegate ID.

If they also don't know their delegate ID number, send me
(jasper.yeh@cutc.ca)  their name and email (that they signed up with!), and I can look them up.

If all else fails, they can simply pay registration@cutc.ca and 
then (please!) email me the transaction ID, name of delegate, email, etc.

If there's absolutely no way to pay by PayPal, then yes, cheques 
can be mailed to:

<li> If you are interested in mathematical typesetting your documents, you could
	take a look at <a href=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~arnold/latex/>these few documents I put together</a>.
<li> CCIT may be interested in hiring you (an upper year CS student) for a TA
	position. Please see their <a href=http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/ccit/1278.0.html>job ad</a>.
<li> Many of you have interesting experience, valuable to others. I know a few of you have J2EE experience, Visual Studio .NET
	experience, cellphone programming experience, game programming experience, Access programming experience. 
	I have often thought about holding Tech sessions, or at the very least
	creating a directory of students with their experiences (so other students can contact you). 
	Please let me know if you are interested in participating.
<li> Anecdotal evidence suggests that it is a very good idea to go to PEY. <font color=green>Cameron has just emailed me a great
	note regarding pey. You can find it <a href=PEY/peyAdvice.txt>here</a>. </font> 
	Many students that have gone to PEY have great jobs. It might also cause a career shift, for example 
	to teaching comp sci instead of development, a move to development instead of analysis and design or vice versa.
<li> Raheel points out that the <a href=http://www.cutc.ca>CUTC Conference</a> is happening again this year.
        I will be looking into funding for conference attendees (from our department). Early registration
        means lower conference fees. Register early.
        Last year we sent 12 students.
	To get an idea about what this is about, see <a href=utmcs/CUTC2003.doc>Omairs review of the 2003 conference</a>

<li> Just in case you don't know, we have two labs, one in ccit and one in 
	the basement in the south building. The names of the labs are 
	CS Underground and CS Tower.
<li> Cameron reports back from industry below, he has some advice for you if you want to use Eclipse with C++...

<xmp>
Hello!

How are things these days?

My work term is going great; I'll have to fill you in with all of the
details some time.

I've recently been looking into C++ GUI development on Windows. I didn't
want to pay an arm and a leg to obtain Visual C++, nor did I really want to
use that as an IDE. Using Visual C++ as an IDE is probably the only part of
my job that I hate.

Saying that, I started looking into various cross-platform C++ GUI
frameworks. I took a look at the Fox Toolkit, QT, and wxWidgets. I ended up
picking wxWidgets because their framework has been in development for the
past 12 years, and it has a good reputation online.

I really like using Eclipse with Java, so I wanted to use Eclipse with C++.
So began the 5 or 6 day long adventure while I actually tried to get
everything compiled and running. I kept running into these road blocks. I
was very disappointed in the lack of online documentation when it came to
configuring Eclipse, MinGW, and wxWidgets. When I finally got it all
working, I wrote everything up in a large document and put it online:

http://howtos.mrcam.org/guides/development/cppguiprogramming.html

You might want to mention this to people, just in case they're interested in
C++ GUI development (without resorting to Visual C++.) I know the past week
would have been much easier if I had this type of document near by. The only
reason I wrote the document was because if I had to do this again in a
month, I'd most likely forget everything I discovered this past week. I hope
others can benefit from this page aswell.

<li> Physics will be posting a couple of work-study projects and we (CS) will be collaborating
	on a project with them. Brief details follow:
<p>
Physics has purchased a couple of very interesting graphics cards. These can
do volumetric rendering of three dimensional datasets. They are interested in 
generating a dataset which simultaneously captures different views 
(not in the sense you are probably thinking) of the same object. 
<p>
For this project, you will be working with VC++ under MS Windows, you will learn
the API for the <a href=http://www.rtviz.com/products/vp_1000_1_prod.html>VolumePro1000</a>
(including data formats) to modify an existing application so that it can take advantage
of the information now stored in your generated datasets.
<p>
If you are interested in this opportunity (as a work-study or 492 project) please contact me (arnold@cs.toronto.edu) or Virgis Barzda (vbarzda@utm.toronto.edu).

<li> A student is interested in getting some help with csc350 this summer, 
	let me know if you would like to help them. I have posted an extract of their
	message below...
<xmp>
I am a fourth year Computer Science student and have a deferred exam in       
CSC350 in August. I needed some help in the course and I        
was wondering if you would be able to recommend anyone who might be           
willing to tutor me?                                                          
                                                                               
I would really appreciate it if you could let me know as I needed some        
help for a few sessoins.      
</xmp>
<li> Got some interesting 492 projects going on this summer. Check them out below. 
<li> I am forming some connections with <a href=http://www.surg.med.utoronto.ca/bmc/>Biomedical Communications</a>. 
and already have connections with Forensics. Let me know if you are interested in visualization, volumetric rendering, simulation, modelling etc.
especially in the context of a 492 project. One possibility is modelling, visualization and classification 
of fingerprints. 
<li> If you have an interesting website, I would like to know about it. I will be speaking
with potential UTM students on Sunday June 6 and want to show them just what 
we can do. Remember, bringing great students to UTM increases the value of your
UTM degree. If you are interested in attending the session (12-3 Sunday June 6), 
please let me know. New students may like to speak with you.
<li> We submitted a proposal for 3 work-study positions for next year. Keep this
	in mind for next year.
<li> Next year, we will be offering an internship course (under CSC492 initially). 
	This course will place you at an employer parttime while you study at UTM.
	The difference between this and PEY is that internship=part time and credit (so you pay for a course)
	and it has some deliverables attached to it. PEY=full time, paid for a year (or so) with no credit attached.
	If you are a Math/CS student and are interested, please let me know.
<li> Our performance in PEY is (on the surface) on par with StGeorge. I would guess
	that some of the 'StGeorge' students with PEY placements are actually
	former UTM students so that we actually place above StGeorge, but hey, 
	I teach at UTM. 
<li> You may be interested in the <a href=http://www.topcoder.com>topcoder competition</a>
<li> 
<xmp>
Please announce to graduating students ASAP. Thanks!

<li> Here is what a StGeorge student has to say about UTM's CSC program...
<xmp>
I must admit that after viewing your web page, the learning experience 
that UTM students have in 309 (and even other courses like their 492 
projects) smashed a lot of preconceptions I had about the UTM campus. 
 Some of the opportunities at your campus don't even appear to be 
offered here at St. George.  Are any of those 492 projects you offer 
open to St. George students?
</xmp>

<li> Omair points out that the <a href=http://www.cutc.ca>CUTC Conference</a> is happening again this year. Our department is willing to fund

<li> <font color=green>OPPORTUNITY</font> 
	If you have taken CSC309 and are looking to gain some experience (put some more lines on your resume). 
	Please contact me. I have a temporary, voluntary (no $) position for the Mississauga government.
	The basic project involves creating a web front end to a collection of Access databases. High level information
	is displayed on the initial page and (depending on the users choices) more refined information will be displayed.
	The technology you will be able to place on your resume includes <b>ASP, Access, SQL, IIS</b>.
<li> For UTM programs, you can use CSC369 in place of CSC468 if you wish.
<li> UofT has paid for you to access a hugh collection of Journals. You should take the opportunity
	to browse through these by going to the UofT library site. Of particular interest
        to us is Communications of the ACM and IEEE Computer.
<li> Clubs week is this week (10-4  Monday to Thursday in the student centre). You should go and
        check out all the interesting clubs (especially the CSAE, your computer science association).
<li> If you can't take csc207 (which promises to be a very interesting course), grab and read a copy of 'The Pragmatic Programmer' by Hunt and Thomas an excellent book (suggested by Prof. Craig). Better yet, do both.

<xmp>
Hi everybody:
                                                                                                            
as most of you know, I played more than my fair share of poker in the
past year or so. Despite making thousands at it, I got interested in
poker writing even more. My submission for the upcoming volume "Poker
and Philosophy" was narrowly rejected even though the chief editor loved
it.... (Ahhh.... my first rejection slip... I was pissed only for couple
of days.)
                                                                                                            
The good news is that I got hired as a columnist for ITH, one of fastest
growing poker communities in the world, run by Matt Hilger (poker pro
and author, finished 30th at last year's WSOP for a cool 80k payday). My
first article is up. See http://www.internettexasholdem.com/. I write
and post under the name "Bohemian".
                                                                                                            
Other news: teacher's college is almost over (there IS a god!). Can't
wait. Heading to Miami Beach for two weeks after that, and then maybe to
Vegas in June to play in event #5 in the World Series of Poker ($1500 US
buy-in). Should be a great summer.
                                                                                                            
To those of you who don't keep in touch: how are you? What's happening?
                                                                                                            
Hope all is well at your end,
R.

<xmp>
Hi Prof. Arnold
                                                                                                 
I thought you might know students who would be interested. I've been meaning to
send an update on how things are on the job front but things have been quite
hectic on this end.
                                                                                                 
I'm currently working at Millenium Research Group (http://www.mrg.net) as an IT
Analyst. Mostly designing and administering databases (MSSQL, MySQL, Access),
creating statistical online surveys (PHP, JS, etc.), website development and
having to create tools in VB and C# to work around Microsoft. I also did some in
house application development in C# using .NET tools and just recently completed
and deployed a web-based, php application for managing contact information
within the company.
                                                                                                 
Hope everything is going well at Erindale.

</xmp>
	Cameron says the following about the interview...
<xmp>
The interview was mainly composed of C++ technical questions (about 90%
technical, 10% HR related questions.) I found the knowledge I gained from
reading 'Effective C++' (ISBN: 0201924889) was a big help. They were also
very interested in my past TA experience as well as the last assignment we
had in 309.
</xmp>
	<li> Billal is graduating and is very happy to be headed to CGI

         system, using C , no sizeof allowed etc)
CSC 309 (e.g Synchronization,threads etc)
CSC 209 (Unix system calls)
CSC 369 (OS concepts)

<li> <h3>Congrats!!</h3>
For those of you that graduated a few days ago. I am sorry that I missed the graduation 
(thanks Edward, Sobia and Sadia for reminding me about what I missed)
You all know that I take great pride in what you have accomplished. Missing your graduation
was missing my graduation. I have gotten to know many of you and realize now that I 
won't have you knocking on my door every couple of days. I am really going to miss that.
<p>
I know that you are all now in a position to take hold of your
lives (I have posted some of your accomplishments below (please send me more updates)).
<p>
Most of you are now starting to realise that the trials that I put you through in my
classes were actually worthwhile. You have everything to be confident about,
make sure that you enjoy life. 
<p>
Because I like standing in front of you and talking, here is some of my famous words of wisdom:
<ul>
<li> Those that are happiest, know what they have. Make sure that you enjoy what you have,
	believe me, people get older, things happen. If you don't believe me, go visit your grandmother
	and remember, she was once your age and also wasn't going to get older.
<li> If you do something something happens, if you do nothing, nothing happens. Get out,
	take opportunities (because of the things they will lead to and the things you 
	can't even see them leading to).
<li> Enjoy your work. I do and it makes all the difference.
<li> Turn off that voice in your head that yells doubts and insults at you. It does not help.

<li> Listen to your intuition, it sometimes can tell you a lot about a situation even though
	you can't back up it's conclusions with solid reasons. 
<li> You can understand anything you want. Use this power to your advantage, think and understand.
<li> To Understand: Know what you know, know what you don't, know how to cover the difference and then cover it.
